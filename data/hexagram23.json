    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Disintegration means overthrowing or being overthrown: the magnetic lines attack the dynamic line at the top in order to change it into one of themselves. It is unwise to move in any direction because inferior elements are now increasing in power. The superior man, observing this, stops all forward movement. He defers to the exigency of the time, realizing that increase and decrease, ripeness and decay are cyclic rhythms.",
        "Legge": "Disintegrationis the symbol of falling or causing to fall, and refers to the process of decay or overthrow in both the natural and political worlds. The figure consists of five yin lines below and one yang line on top. Decay has begun at the bottom and crept upward. The hexagram symbolizes the ninth month when summer has passed and the year is about to fall into the sterile arms of winter. In the political world, inferior men have gradually displaced good men until only one remains. The lesson for him is to wait because the power operating against him is too strong. Eventually a change for the better will appear. The specific image is that of a bed and its occupant, and the symbolism describes the attempts made to overthrow him. The lower trigram of Docility and the upper trigram of Keeping Still suggest to the superior man of line six how he can best deal with the prevailing circumstances. The situation is not hopeless -- winter is followed by spring, night by day, and the waning moon soon grows full again. So will it be in the course of human affairs. \n The idea behind the Image is that a mountain has the earth for its foundation. If the earth is thick, the mountain preserves its height. So it is with the sovereign and people."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:Disintegration means do not act. \n The Superior Man stabilizes his responses and seeks tranquility. \n The twenty-third hexagram is the inverse ofReturn, the hexagram immediately following it. Each figure depicts an opposite pole in a cyclic progression. Here the old cycle has disintegrated to the point of dissolution. The following hexagram depicts theReturnto the beginning of a new cycle. \n The first four lines of Disintegration show the gradual erosion of a position or frame of reference, symbolized by a bed or couch. The inferior forces creep up from below like termites to undermine a solid foundation. The fifth line shows a gathering of forces for a potentially positive transformation, and the top line suggests the first stages of this transformation. The implication is that times of disintegration needn't always be regarded as negative, or a foregone conclusion. We still have the choice to alter conditions in our favor. \n That the superior man \"strengthens his inferiors\" to insure the stability of his position, means that one stabilizes one's psychological situation by defusing the causes of rebellion -- safeguard the foundation where it is weak. Hexagram number forty-three, Resoluteness, is a negative picture of this figure, and the message in the Image is very similar: \"The superior man does not hoard his wealth, but shares it with his subordinates.\"  The idea is subtle -- it doesn't mean to indulge your weaknesses, but to monitor them encouragingly so that they may become transformed into positive forces. \n\n\n Whenever we go deep enough toward the core of a sub- personality, we find that the core -- which is some basic urge, or need -- is good. For practical purposes, this can be considered an absolute. No matter how many layers of distortion may surround it, the basic need, the basic motivation, is a good one -- and if it becomes twisted, it was because of not being able to express itself directly. The real core -- not what the sub- personality wants, but what it needs -- is good. A basic purpose of the coordination phase is to discover this central urge or need, to make it conscious, and to find acceptable ways in which it can be satisfied and fulfilled. And, provided we have sufficient understanding and skill, it can be satisfied -- if not fully, at least enough to maintain the process of growth. \nJames Vargiu -- Subpersonalities",

Persons of inferior persuasions have entered the situation from below and are creating an environment for Deterioration. The time bodes evil for persons of integrity.

Thus, the injury or disintegration of the legs is synonymous with \"not having a leg to stand on.\" The image suggests the destruction of a fundamental premise which is essential for correct behavior. \n\n\n That a bed signifies doctrine, is from correspondence, for as the body rests in its bed, so does the mind rest in its doctrine. \nSwedenborg \n\n A.

Cleary (2): Loses above and below. Wu: He is not associated with those around him. \n Legge: Line three also represents an over-thrower, but it differs from the others by being the correlate of line six, who is her ally. Three's allegiance is to the sixth line and not, as with the other magnetic lines, to one of her own kind.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  Because of circumstances beyond his control, the man finds himself associating with evil men. His inner relationship with a superior man enables him to retain his righteous stability, leading to opposition from inferior people. \n Wing:  Circumstances have led you into a situation in which you must work with inferior persons or ideals. If you can, nevertheless, maintain a strong tie with a superior element, you will avoid Deterioration and free yourself of regretful errors. \n Editor:  Wilhelm says: \"He splits with them.\" Blofeld renders it: \"He peels them all off.\" These are images of separation or differentiation -- a setting apart. Disintegrationis an upside-down image of the hexagram of Return, and if it is inverted, this line takes the place of line four in Return: \"Walking in the midst of others, one returns alone.\" Wu's Confucian commentary on line three here says: \u201cHe is not associated with those around him,\u201d which reinforces this idea. \n\n\n The disintegrating tendencies very often result in psychosis if the unconscious and conscious clash, for then they have prevailed and the person falls into all those parts which are hostile to each other, as, for instance, when the psychotic person hears different voices which quarrel with each other. On the other hand, we know also that the unconscious contains synthesizing or integrating tendencies, which issue from that regulating center which Jung calls the Self. \nM.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination\n\n A. Make a distinction between yourself and inferior elements within the situation, perhaps an attitude."

Legge\u2019s translation suggests that the dynamic sixth line may be regarded as the bed\u2019s symbolic occupant -- i.e., it's his skin which is being flayed. Psychologically interpreted, this can suggest the Self which is in some sense em-bed-ed in its satellite complexes. \n\n\n Even at the height of [Hitler's] power there was for him no Germany, there were no German troops for whom he felt himself responsible; for him there was -- at first sub-consciously, but in his last years fully consciously -- only one greatness, a greatness which dominated his life and to which his evil genius sacrificed everything -- his own ego. \r\n           Colonel-General Franz Halder \n\n A.

Wu: There will be no resentment in the end. \n Legge: With line five the symbolism changes. She is the ruler of all the other magnetic lines who are at her disposal. They are imaged as fishes (which come under the category of yin), following each other as if strung together. The ruler of these yin lines is loyal to the yang sixth line, the rightful sovereign in his palace, and she leads the others to him to enjoy his favors.

There is now a possibility for success in your endeavors. \n Editor:  This is an image of an intermediate power organizing inferior powers to lend support to (or obtain favors from) a superior power. Psychologically interpreted, one can think of ego, archetypal complexes and Self, respectively. \n\n\n The governor of a circle is of course its center, around which everything revolves. In the psyche likewise, the center is ruler of the entire man. In the conscious realm the ego is master, but in this larger sphere the ego is only one voice among many. The ruler here must transcend the ego. It must be a suprapersonal value that can command the allegiance and obedience of the ego, just as the ego, through the development of consciousness, comes to transcend the [archetypal complexes]. This ruler Jung has called the Self. \nM.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy\n\n A. An approaching synthesis. Disparate forces are brought under control. \n B.

Dwelling:in the symbolism of this line, the dwellings of the inferior men are the focal points of autonomous, unregenerate forces within the psyche: desires, appetites, etc. But now these foci are overthrown, so the inferior forces no longer \"have a home.\" Generally speaking, this line tells us that the time of disintegration has passed or will soon change for the better. As Legge points out in his commentary on the hexagram: \"The situation is not hopeless -- winter is followed by spring, night by day, and the waning moon soon grows full again. So will it be in the course of human affairs.\" \n\n\n Happy is the virtuous man, for he will feed on the fruit of his deeds; Woe to the wicked, evil is on him, he will be treated as his actions deserve. \nIsaiah 3: 10-11 \n\n A.

A dynamic line is in the highest place, displaying the worth of talent and virtue -- his is the power that keeps Strength in restraint and displays the will necessary to the hexagram. Talents and virtue are nourished because he refuses to confine his power within his immediate family. Heaven in the second line responds to the ruler in the fifth, thus it is favorable to cross the great stream.",
        "Legge": "Controlled Power symbolizes both restraint and the accumulation of virtue. What is restrained accumulates its strength and increases its volume to become a great reservoir of force. The Judgment teaches that if one is firm and correct in this endeavor he may then engage in public service and enjoy the king's grace. \n The dynamic line in the highest place is line six who is above the ruler and has all of heaven in which to move. This, plus the power to suppress the strongest opposition, shows how he is supported by all that is correct. \n Concerning the Image, Chu Hsi says: \"Heaven is the greatest of all things, and its being in the midst of a mountain gives us the idea of a very large accumulation. This is analogous to the labor of the superior man in learning, acquiring and remembering, to accumulate his virtue.\""
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:Controlled Power is willpower. The ego renounces selfish indulgences to work for the good of the whole. With such a spirit, great transformations are possible. \n The Superior Man studies the precepts of the Work to increase his comprehension and fortitude. \n The essential image to remember in this hexagram is that of Mount Everest holding down Heaven itself: raw power is controlled by the sheer mass of Keeping Still. Thus we see that Controlled Power is Willpower -- arguably the most potentially creative force in the universe, because used correctly it can accomplish anything. \n\n\n The will is, curiously, not recognized as the central and fundamental function of the ego. It has often been depreciated as being ineffective against the various drives and the power of the imagination, or it has been considered with suspicion as leading to self-assertion (will-to-power). But the latter is only a perverted use of the will, while the apparent futility of the will is due only to a faulty and unintelligent use. The will is ineffective only when it attempts to act in opposition to the imagination and to the other psychological functions, while its skilful and consequently successful use consists in regulating and directing all other functions toward a deliberately chosen and affirmed aim. \nRoberto Assagioli \u2013Psychosynthesis \n\n\n An extreme example of this is illustrated by Cleary\u2019s commentary on the Judgment where he says: \u201cThis is the work referred to as \u201cnine years facing a wall.\u201d The reference is to Bodhidharma (the patriarch who brought Zen Buddhism to China), who meditated facing a wall for nine continuous years until he attained enlightenment. \n\"If its subject doesn't enjoy his family revenues at the expense of public service, there will be good fortune\u201d is an image of the ego renouncing its illusions of free choice. Psychologically, inner complexes will drain energy from the situation unless the ego has the will to control their manifestation. Every line except the sixth depicts some kind of restraint of power -- only in the top line is the energy available for use. It is significant that the superior man is advised to study the ancient wisdom, for it is in the Mysteries, the Perennial Philosophy, that one discovers the secrets and applications of the will. In other contexts (for example, a question about business matters), this can refer to making connection with sound and established practices. \n In the larger philosophical sense, we see that the evolving illusions of every age insure that the masses will remain attached to the wheel of birth and death -- continuously repeating endless variations of the same basic lessons. When each individual is finally ready to escape from these cycles, it is only within the ancient and eternal template of the Work that transcendence can be found. \n\n\n The analogies between religious ideas in Jewish mysticism that are hundreds of years old and the scientific findings of modern psychology can be explained only by the archetypal structure of the psyche. Man's images and ideas concerning the mysteries of being fall into the timeless patterns arranged by the archetypes of the unconscious; his meditations are determined by them. Within the setting of his culture and his time, he creates new forms for the expression of age-old truths. \nA. Jaffe -- The Myth of Meaning \n\n\n Through contact with the Self, negative cycles can be broken and positive cycles begun, but it always requires a mountain's worth of Controlled Powerto make it happen.",

There should be no conflict. \n Editor:  A modern image might be an automobile up on blocks \u2013 a vehicle is immobilized. In a strange mixture of metaphors, from the ruler's perspective (see Legge's commentary on line five), this second line correlate is seen as a castrated boar -- a potentially dangerous force which has been transformed into a safe one. Usually the line simply means that no action is possible at this time. \n\n\n Here I am speaking not of a power complex, or of an identification with the will to power, but rather of the feeling of ability to control oneself and one's actions, and of the power to choose a goal and to do what is necessary to achieve it. This is a positive factor leading to self-discipline and culture, and on its development civilization largely depends. \nM.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy \n\n A.

Wu: His wish is in consonance with the one above. \n Legge:  Line three is the last of the trigram of Creative Power and it responds to the top line of the upper trigram of Keeping Still. As they are both dynamic the latter does not exert his repressive force. They advance rapidly together, but the position of the third line is perilous. By firmness and caution, however, its subject will escape the peril, and the issue will be good. When the action of the hexagram has reached line six, its work is done. Line six will no longer exercise repression, but join with line three, assisting his advance.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man is joined by strong allies who are going in the same direction. The obstacles begin to give way. But the dangers are not over. He must remain alert, well prepared, and farsighted. \n Wing:  The path will begin to open for you, and your progress will be unhindered. Others may join forces with you. Nevertheless, you must constantly keep your personal goals in mind. Remain cautious. \n Editor:  Think of the lower trigram as a kind of throttle, and the upper trigram as the brakes and you have an image of driving, or \"charioteering.\" A good driver uses both throttle and brakes as required to advance the vehicle toward its destination. To switch metaphors, a master samurai warrior is so in tune with the Zen of the battle that his advance and retreat (throttle and brakes) attain a kind of poetic transcendence. \"Daily exercise\" means that the requirements of the Work are dynamic and constantly changing -- what was an appropriate response yesterday may be totally incorrect today, yet essential again tomorrow. One must constantly stay on top of the changes taking place. Take nothing for granted. The line tells us explicitly how hard this is to do: \"It will be advantageous for him to realize the difficulty of his course.\" Ritsema/Karcher translate \"horse\" as: \"...Symbol of spirited strength in the natural world, counterpart of dragon...\" In the context imaged here, this energy is under the control of the will and capable of full performance. The Confucian commentary tells us that Self and ego are in accord on this one. The overall image suggests forces seeking equilibrium -- with will and intent the outcome can be positive. \n\n\n In all forms of strategy, it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in everyday life and to make your everyday stance your combat stance. \nMusashi -- A Book of Five Rings\n\n A. Exercise your willpower by staying on top of a constantly changing situation. The warrior spirit advances the Work."

Instead of squandering your resources on premature advancements, you have built up a strong reserve of potential energy. Good fortune. \n Editor: Blofeld, Shaughnessy and Cleary render \"ox\" instead of \"bull\" -- an unfortunate word choice. (Since an ox is a castrated bull, the meaning of the line is muddled.) The image is one of energy which grows -- i.e., matures and accumulates. To shape this accumulation within the structure of a higher ideal or intent (the \"headboard\") is to maintain control over it and prevent its autonomous release. Psychologically, the metaphor suggests a forming template, such as the precepts of the Work (\"the words and deeds of ancient men\u201d in the Image), which shapes consciousness in accordance with an archetypal ideal. This raises the issue of the difference between disciplined sublimation and repression: \n\n\n In the face of a seemingly insoluble conflict, awareness and discipline are called for.

To sublimate is to \"make sublime\" -- that is, to transform a lower impulse into a higher one: to refashion that which is coarse into that which is fine.

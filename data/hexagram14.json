    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Wealth shows the magnetic line in the central ruler's place, and honored by the dynamic lines above and below. The figure is composed of the trigrams of Strength and Clarity. The central line of Clarity responds to the central line of Strength, eventuating in timely action. This indicates great progress and success.",
        "Legge": "Wealth means \"great havings,\" and symbolizes a kingdom, family or individual in a state of prosperity. The danger in such a position arises from the pride it is likely to engender. Here however, everything is against that: the place of honor is occupied by a magnetic line, so that the ruler will be humble, and all the dynamic lines will respond to her with sympathetic allegiance. The ruler's seat is in the central position of the trigram of Clarity, and hence her strength is directed by intelligence, and all her actions are timely, like the seasons of heaven.\n Fire above the sky shines far -- symbolizing the vastness of the territory of wealth. To develop virtue and repress evil is in accordance with the will of heaven, which has given to all men a nature fitted for goodness.\n Cleary (2): All states of being have this essence inherent in them and are indeed made of this essence, but all states other than that of complete enlightenment are out of harmony with this essence in some way. Buddhahood is when you accord with this essence.\n Wu: As the sun shines brightly high in the sky, both the good and the bad will be exposed. The responsibility of the jun zi is to discriminate between them. He acts in accordance with the nature of goodness (the will of heaven) to enrich his life."

If the thirteenth hexagram depicts a process of uniting, the fourteenth might be seen as the completion of that process. To have one's inner forces correctly united is indeed Possession in Great Measure, which is the title that Wilhelm gives to this figure.\n It is emphasized in the Image that this Wealth must be administered in accordance with the \"benevolent will of heaven,\u201d which is to say: the principles of the Work must always guide one's choices if one is not to lose equilibrium and become pauperized by illusion.\n\n\n The superior man considers a rich possession of moral principles to be honor, and peace in his person to be wealth. \nChou Tun-I",

Therefore, you have made no mistakes. Keep in mind that the situation is at its beginning and difficulties may lie on the road ahead. With forewarned awareness you can remain blameless.\n Editor: The image suggests a situation of great potential which could be ruined through bad choices of action. Recognize the difficulty of maintaining your will under such circumstances. Wilhelm\u2019s version of the Confucian commentary and Wu\u2019s translations of both line and commentary don\u2019t follow the other translators. Their interpretations seem anomalous unless the specific situation concurs.\n\n\n There is merely a thin borderline between individuation as a conscious process and the disruption and dissolution of the personality -- breakdown or even psychosis -- which takes place when the unconscious gains the upper hand. (Hence also the closeness of genius and insanity and the danger of \"short cut\u201d methods of entering the unconscious, such as drugs.) The outcome of the confrontation with the numinous powers depends upon the attitude of the ego. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest \n\n A.

Ritsema/Karcher: Amassing centering, not destroying indeed. Cleary (2): If the load is balanced you will not fail.

Cleary (2): Small people would be harmed. Wu: This will be unfitting to the little man.\n Legge: Line three is dynamic in a correctly dynamic place. The top line of the lower trigram is the proper place for a feudal lord. He will humbly serve the condescending ruler in the fifth place. An inferior man in the same position, but without the virtue, would give himself airs.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The superior man places his property and talents at the service of the ruler and the public. The inferior man employs them for his own gain.\n Wing:  A superior-minded person will place his talents or resources at the disposal of his leader or his community. Through this type of open generosity he is benefited, for he is loyally supported in turn. A lesser man cannot do this.\n Editor:  This line is often received under painful conditions in which a sacrifice of some kind is demanded. Blofeld and Wu\u2019s versions differ conceptually from the other translators, and may be considered eccentric unless the matter under question supports their interpretations.\n\n\n Whether your task demands abject poverty of you or gives you the greatest wealth, you must always remember that nothing, absolutely nothing, ever or anywhere really belongs to you. On the contrary, everything is God\u2019s property, and from his property you receive something only for your actual needs, corresponding to your task. Just as it's a matter of indifference to a canal whether more or less water flows through it, because the water doesn't belong to it, you too must regard everything fate gives you as something that comes to you from God, and something you must pass on. \nElisabeth Haich --Initiation\n\n A.

He keeps his strength under control, yields not to competition and envy, and does not injure the mild ruler.\n Wing: Quell your pride and envy and do not attempt to compete with others or emulate those in power. Give your full attention to the business at hand and you will avoid mistakes.\n Anthony: When we argue, we engage and compete with other people\u2019s inferiors. We should remain disengaged. Even when we mentally argue with or inwardly look at the problem, we remain engaged, thinking of ways to deal with their inferiors. Such looking to the side causes us to deviate from our own direction.\n Editor:  Wilhelm and Liu both render this line in terms of making a distinction between oneself and others. The distinction to be made is to see the difference between the minister in line four and the ruler in line five -- i.e., don't overstep your authority or aspire above your proper place. The line can also refer to co-dependence to other people's illusions. You have your own unique path to follow: you cannot acquiesce to the unenlightened expectations of others without doing damage to yourself, to them, and to the Work. Choices like this are often extremely painful. This, however, does not absolve the aspirant from doing what the Work demands.\n\n\n Better is one's own dharma, though imperfectly performed, than the dharma of another well performed.

Benevolence on his part, however, must be accompanied by the proper display of majesty. Otherwise, the people will become insolent and lose their attitude of service.\n Wing:  Those whom you may influence are attracted to you through the bond of sincerity. Thus a truthful relationship exists. If you are overly familiar, however, attitudes may become too casual to get things accomplished. A dignified approach brings good fortune.\n Editor: Psychologically, this line expresses the idea that the will of the ego to maintain the letter and spirit of the Work creates a climate of compliance among the other complexes within the psyche.\n\n\n Whatever a great man does, that others follow; \n Whatever he sets up as a standard, that the world follows. \n Bhagavad-Gita 3: 21\n\n A.

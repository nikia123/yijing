    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Consistency means long continuance. The dynamic trigram of Thunder is above, and the magnetic trigram of Wind is below. Docility and Motive Force are in sympathetic communication because their dynamic and magnetic lines all correspond. When the motive power is spent it will begin again -- hence movement in any direction is advantageous. The sun and moon are consistent in their illumination, and the four sequential seasons are consistent in their cycles of growth. The sages are consistent in their work and all under heaven are transformed. When we examine this consistent perseverance the natural tendencies of heaven and earth are revealed.",
        "Legge": "The subject of the hexagram is perseverance in what is right, or in continuously acting out the law of one's being. It is seen as a sequel to the previous hexagram,Initiative. As that figure deals with the correct relations \n between husband and wife, so this figure treats of the continuous observance of their respective duties. Initiativeconsists of the trigrams symbolizing the youngest son and youngest daughter and shows how the attraction and influence between the sexes is strongest in youth. Consistency on the other hand, consists of the trigrams symbolizing the oldest son and oldest daughter. This couple is more staid. The wife occupies the lower place, and their relationship is characterized by her submission. Given two parties, a magnetic and a dynamic in correlation, if both consistently observe what is correct and natural (i.e., the magnetic submissive and the dynamic firm), then good fortune and progress may be predicted for their course."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  The will to maintain the consistency of the Work assures progress in whatever direction it may take. \n The Superior Man holds fast to the principles of the Work. \n Wilhelm's title for this hexagram is Duration. I feel that the word Consistency best evokes the meaning of the figure. In an existence consisting of continuous change the only things that have duration are the principles upon which change is based. To adhere to these principles is to maintain consistency. Implicit here is a consistent balance of forces. Consistency in the Work means neither consistent action nor inaction, but an appropriate combination of the two principles as required by changing circumstances. The Confucian commentary alludes to this characteristic of the Work when it mentions the sun, moon and changing seasons as examples of forces which maintain their consistency within a context of continuous change. \n Just as the moon at night reflects the light of the hidden sun, so in the Work the ego is always magnetic in relation to the dynamic Self. A moon that thought that it was the source of its light would be egregiously deluded, despite superficial appearances to the contrary; so too the ego that thinks that its powers come from anywhere but the Self. \n\n\n Motives and standards of choice are not invented by the ego but are structured by the actualization of archetypal predispositions through personally acquired value standards. \nE. C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest \n\n\n\u00a0\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION \n Note that all of the lines in the hexagram are generally unfavorable except two and five, and that when they both change places the hexagram becomes number thirty-one, Initiative. There is a profound lesson here which is best appreciated by meditating on the associations implied. The fact that each hexagram is the inverse of the other should not be forgotten.",

Ritsema/Karcher: Beginning seeking depth indeed. Cleary (2): The misfortune \u2026 is from seeking depth to start with. Wu: Because he starts by seeking an intimate relationship. \n Legge:  Line one has a proper correlate in four, but between them are two dynamic lines, and it is itself magnetic. These conditions prevent her from receiving much help from line four. She should be quiet and not be anxious for action. The emphasis of what is said derives from her being the first line of the figure, at \"the commencement of things.\"",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset the man wants to endure. Whatever endures must be gradually matured. There is no advantage in precipitous action. \n Wing:  Do not attempt to wholly and quickly embrace a method or system that is new to you. Life-styles cannot be changed overnight. There are no shortcuts to reform. Such things are cultivated and matured in order to bring about the desired results. \n Editor:  The image depicts compulsive persistence in trying to force an issue or in seeking a premature synthesis. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number thirty-four, Great Power,implying that perhaps you are too impatient for results. The Work demands change, and often we long for some measure of stability which is inappropriate to the process taking place. Ritsema/Karcher translate \u201cWithout direction: Harvesting\u201d as: \"No plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events.\" The second clause suggests that circumstances will improve if you just don't meddle with them. \n\n\n A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws.

The husband must decide what is right, and lay down the rule accordingly -- for him to follow like a wife is evil.  Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune for a woman, because she follows one man all her life. A man must hold to his duty; if he follows the woman, the results are bad.  Blofeld:  A woman follows one lord for the whole of her life, but men have to hold to their public duties. For them to subordinate themselves to women would bring shame upon them. Ritsema/ Karcher: Adhering-to the-one and-also completing indeed. Adhering-to the wife: pitfall indeed. Cleary (2): What bodes well in fidelity for a woman is consistency from start to finish. For a man doing his duty, to follow a woman bodes ill. Wu: She perseveres in playing her devoted role to the very end. Ominous for a man, because he should judge each issue on its merit and not follow the role of a woman. \n Legge:  The magnetic fifth line responds to the dynamic second, and may be supposed to represent a wife conscious of her weakness, and docilely submissive, which is correct. A husband, however, and a man generally, has to assert himself, and lay down the rule of what is right. From line five it appears that what is right will vary in different cases. The lesson of the hexagram is perseverance in what is right in each particular case.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man is faithful to tradition and submits meekly. These are desirable virtues for a wife but not for a man of affairs. He should be flexible and assertive, according to the demands of duty and the tenor of the times. \n Wing:  When you are seeking earthly things, apply earthly methods. When your goals are lofty and ambitious, your methods must be inventive and daring. Learn to apply the appropriate kind of effort to achieve the effect you desire. \n Editor:  What appears to be outrageous sexism is seen to be a profound truth when interpreted symbolically. The wife is emotion, the husband reason, and the line examines the crucial division of labor between them. Reason must be flexible or it becomes petrified into dogma; emotion must remain firm and not give in to impulse or it becomes uncontrolled passion. The circumstances of each situation dictate their proper response. In the flux and flow of life, mindless adherence to \"precedent\" is the strategy of shysters and dogmatists. \n\n\n For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction. \nKahlil Gibran -- The Prophet\n\n A. Control your emotions and allow reason to make the choices. Reason should at all times be flexible and allow itself to be guided by the requirements of the time. Emotion, on the other hand, must always maintain a firm adherence to the principles of moderation and restraint."

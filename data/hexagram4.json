        "Legge": "Inexperience means progress and success. I do not seek the inexperienced youth, but he seeks me. When he shows the sincerity proper for divination, I instruct him. If he asks two or three times, that is troublesome, and I do not instruct the troublesome. Firm correctness brings advantage.",
        "Wilhelm/Baynes": "Youthful Folly has success. It is not I who seek the young fool; the young fool seeks me. At the first oracle I inform him. If he asks two or three times, it is importunity. If he importunes, I give him no information. Perseverance furthers.",
        "Blofeld": "Immaturity. Good fortune! I am not one to seek out uncultivated youths, but if such a youth seeks me out, I shall at first read and explain the omens. Yet should he ask me many times, just because of his importunity, I shall not explain anything more. The omen indicates a need for proper direction.  [This hexagram suggests stubbornness (the upper trigram) issuing from the softness of the womb (the lower trigram). While it sometimes happens that youthful rashness succeeds where sober counsels fail, it is nevertheless the duty of the mature man to cultivate the minds of the young and to respond, within reason, to their requests for guidance. As an omen, this hexagram may be taken to imply a case in which a certain amount of rashness may lead to success, but in which older people are not absolved from the duty of guiding the young. There is also a suggestion that the Book of Change itself, though fully responsive to those who make the right approach, will not brook importunity in the form of trivial questions or of seeking to reverse its judgments by further questioning. Whether the omen may be taken to mean that we should go ahead with some rash scheme or that it is time for us to restrain someone's youthful rashness will depend upon the nature of the enquiry, the people concerned in it and the particular moving lines involved in the response.]",

It emphasizes that actively accepting this concealment in order to nurture growth is the adequate way to handle it...]",

As in divination, he will be instructed the first time. If he asks the same question for the second and third times, he is disrespectful. Having been judged disrespectful, he will not be instructed again. It will be advantageous to be persevering."

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Inexperience shows the trigram of the Mountain above that of the Abyss. The perilous impasse suggested by these figures evokes the idea of inexperience. Progress and success are suggested because the action and development of the hexagram conform to the requirements of the time. When inexperience seeks wisdom, will responds to will. The oracle responds to sincerity because it has the qualities of the dynamic line in the central second place, but the oracle does not respond to ignorant importuning. The proper duty of a sage is to nourish the correct nature of the ignorant.",
        "Legge": "Difficulty shows us plants struggling within the earth, and Inexperiencesuggests the small and undeveloped sprouts which then appear upon its surface. This is an image of youthful ignorance, and the object of the hexagram is to show how those in authority should deal with it. The Judgment takes the form of the oracle's response to the questioner.\n The upper trigram represents a frowning mountain which blocks the progress of the traveler. The lower trigram symbolizes a stream of water in a dangerous canyon, such as might be found at the foot of a mountain. The combination of these symbols suggests the perilous nature of ignorant inexperience.\n The subject of line two represents the oracle, who demands sincerity from the unenlightened. It is his duty to evoke the innate \"correct nature\" hidden within the questioner, to bring this quality out and develop it. In regard to the Image, Chu Hsi says that \"the water of a spring is sure to move on and gradually advance.\" This may serve as a symbol of the general process and progress of education."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Inexperience portrays the relationship between the ego and the Self as one of student to master. Communication via the oracle demands seriousness of purpose -- the Self refuses to pander to the ego's illusions.\n The Superior Man furthers the Work by developing his will and intent.\n Wilhelm's title for this hexagram is Youthful Folly, which tends to lend it a negative connotation that is not always strictly applicable. However, he is quick to point out that the title \"should be understood to mean the immaturity of youth and its consequent lack of wisdom, rather than mere stupidity.\"\n While the title of Inexperience avoids the negative connotation, it must be acknowledged that there is an aura of irritation in this hexagram which illustrates an uncomfortable truth about the relationship between the ego and the Self. The Self is an awesome archetype, and once one has established contact with him, he assumes a distinctly stern personality. The Self will not pander to the ego's illusions, and has no patience with anything but the unvarnished truth. Tact and patience are not among his attributes. Lao Tse describes him very accurately:\n\n\nThe Sage is unkind: He treats the people like sacrificial straw dogs.\n\n\n Which is just the way it is. As a satellite of the Self, the ego-complex was not created just so that it could spend a lifetime indulging its fantasies. The Work must be undertaken, and the Self knows more than you do what remains to be done. Like any excellent teacher, he demands more of us than we think we have in us to give. This phenomenon of the tyrannical and often \"unjust\" Self has been noted in many times and places. Here is an example from Neo-Platonism:\n\n\n What shall we say in regard to the question: \"Why do the divinities that are invoked require the worshipper to be just, although they themselves when entreated consent to perform unjust acts?\" In reply to this I am uncertain in respect to what is meant by \"performing unjust acts,\" as the same definition may not appear right both to us and to the gods. We, on the one hand, looking to that which is least significant, consider the things that are present, the momentary life, what it is and how it originates. The beings superior to us, let me say, know for certain the whole life of the soul and all its former lives; and if they bring on a retribution from the supplication of those who invoke them, they do not increase it beyond what is just. On the contrary, they aim at the sins impressed upon the soul in former lifetimes, which men do not perceive, and so imagine that is unjust that they fall into the misfortunes which they suffer. \nIamblichus -- The Egyptian Mysteries\n\n\n A contemporary expression of this idea comes from consciousness researcher, John Lilly, famous for his work with dolphins and isolation tank experiments with psychedelic drugs:\n\n\n Cosmic Love [e.g., the Spiritual Self] is absolutely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not. \nJohn Lilly\n\n\n By definition, \"the gods\" (archetypes) are not human. Were it possible for them to evolve without human vessels in Spacetime, presumably we humans would not exist. It is these archetypes, in the guise of our complexes and limiting beliefs, that are being altered by the Work. Because the unconscious psyche is a multiverse, it is sometimes very difficult to differentiate just \"who\" is advising us, and the Self via the oracle, will occasionally test us for our ability to use intuitive common sense.\n Which is to say: when the gods (or the \"Self\") become totally \"unreasonable,\" we can only go along with them to the limit of our human understanding. Slavish obedience to all injunctions from the unconscious is to sell our souls outright to something that we don't understand. The renunciation of \"common sense\" is the renunciation of our most precious birthright.\n On the other hand, to \"disobey\" at will is to put our souls at risk. This is one of the most painful of all dilemmas -- how far do we go in our obedience to unseen powers? Aspects of this problem have been called The Dark Night of the Soul -- an inner initiation, a trial by fire to see what we are really made of. There are times in the advanced course of the Work when one receives the strange insight that the Self actually wants us to disobey! This ordeal can only be lived through -- no one can advise you except your own sense of what is right for you at any given moment.\n The most useful guideline that I have found is that the precepts of the Work (as found in the Perennial Philosophy) are consistent worldwide, and constitute a reliably moral structure for responsible choice. If the oracle seems to be telling you to do something contrary to your inner sense of right and wrong, contrary to your understanding of the precepts of the Work, then go with this intuition rather than the oracle. The Self, via the oracle, will test you in many ways to make you develop. (The ultimate goal is to become so infallibly intuitive that oracles become superfluous.)\n The gods need our intelligent disobedience if they themselves are to evolve. It is in the stress between obedience and conscientious disobedience that growth takes place. In one sense, whatever choice you make, as long as it is conscious and you fully accept the consequences, is the right choice for you at that moment. We learn through our mistakes, and can never fail our lessons if we truly integrate the experience into our unfolding lives.\n Confucius, one of the greatest teachers who ever lived, obviously took his teaching method from the Judgment of this hexagram:\nThe Master said:\"I won't teach a man who is not anxious to learn, and will not explain to one who is not trying to make things clear to himself. And if I explain one- fourth and the man doesn't go back and reflect and think out the implications in the remaining three-fourths for himself, I won't bother to teach him again.\"\n And so it is with the oracle (the Self) -- the deeper one gets involved in the Work, the more difficult the lessons become, so that one is always kept in a position of relative Inexperience. There are times, when a simple answer would suffice, that you will receive an ambiguous image, which (if you do three-fourths of the work), will lead you to a profound insight.",

Cleary (1): It is beneficial to use punishments, by the correct method. [The correct method of breaking down ignorance is not emotional attack.] Wu: It is a method of correcting wayward behaviors.\n Legge: The first line, magnetic, and at the bottom of the figure, is in the grossest ignorance. Let her be punished. If punishment avails to loosen the shackles from the mind, well and good. If not, and if the punishment is prolonged, the effect will be bad.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the ignorant youth is being disciplined for the seriousness of life. Care should be exercised against attempts at rigid regimentation of the mind.\n Wing:  A little discipline is necessary here. There is not enough seriousness of attitude concerning the work to be done, and therefore the atmosphere is not conducive to proper growth. Yet, keep in mind that too many restrictions may lead to uncreative development. Apply just enough guidelines to keep things moving in the proper direction.\n Editor:  Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all render \"punishment\" as \"discipline.\" The idea is that the discipline of a rigid structure, or confinement to basic principles prunes the psyche of its illusions -- \"removes the shackles from the mind.\" Excessive discipline is counterproductive, however: A dynamic balance must be sought between the tyrannies of permissiveness and repression. The line is saying two things, and the balance between them is the lesson. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number 41, Compensating Sacrifice, which deals with finding balance. (Note, however that both of Cleary\u2019s translations interpret the message as a warning against removing shackles! His interpretation seems to be in the minority.)\n\n\n In reality the highest form of compassion may be in withdrawing from a given person any direct physical aid that would spare him a painful lesson, withholding it so that he would never again have to act according to a particular kind of program. The best teachers know that compassion does not prevent pain but allows pain to teach. Of course, carried to an extreme this too can be used in the service of destruction. \nJohn Lilly -- Simulations of God\n\n A. Too much discipline is as bad as too little -- seek the mean.\n B. The school of hard knocks -- learn from your pain or confusion.\n C. Let go of your illusions or strongly held attitudes about the matter at hand."

The divine law cannot be avoided. It has within itself the power to achieve what it has determined upon. Without knowing it, the guilty one is transported to places where it is suitable that it serve its sentence. Carried by uncertain movement, drifting everywhere, it ends, after wanderings and much fatigue because of foolish resistance, by tumbling into its appropriate place. And there it offers itself willingly to an unwilled suffering. Law prescribes the amount and duration of penalties. At the same moment that the penalty ceases, the power is given of escaping the place of chastisement thanks to the harmony that governs all things. \nPlotinus -- The Enneads\n\n A. Correction is not punishment. Accept the consequences of your choices. Don't focus on the pain, but rather on the lesson that it offers.\n B. Do what needs doing and let the chips fall where they may.\n\n April 19, 2001, 4/23/06"

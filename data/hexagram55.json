    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "The greatness of Expansion of Awareness is due to Movement directed by Clarity. Although the king has attained this state, he must still make it greater. But there is no need for anxiety -- let him be as the sun at noon: let his clarity shine on all under the sky. As soon as sun and moon reach zenith their light begins to wane. The intercourse of heaven and earth alternates between abundance and scarcity. It waxes and wanes according to the seasons. How much more so with men or spiritual forces! [Ritsema/Karcher translate \"spiritual forces\" [Kuei Shen] as: \"The whole range of imaginal beings both inside and outside the individual; spiritual powers, gods, demons, ghosts, powers, fetishes.\" -- Ed.]",
        "Legge": "The written Chinese character denoting Expansion of Awarenessis the symbol of being large and abundant -- a condition of prosperity. In human affairs, prosperity often gives place to its opposite. The lesson of the hexagram is to show how the ruler may preserve the prosperity of his state and people. The component trigrams show Motive Force under the direction of Intelligence. A ruler with these attributes will not fail to maintain the progress and development of his kingdom. He is told not to be anxious, but to study how he may always be like the sun at its zenith, cheering and enlightening all. \n It must be noted that a change has been introduced in this hexagram in explaining the symbolism of the lines. Normally, for two lines to have a correct relationship one must be female (magnetic) and the other male (dynamic). Here two dynamic male lines make a proper correlation in the first and fourth places. \n In the Image, lightning appears as the natural phenomenon of which Clarity is the symbol in the lower trigram. The virtues of Clarity and Movement are required of the superior man in judging litigation."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Don't grieve when the truth hurts: a loss of illusion is a gain in awareness. Once truly attained, enlightenment cannot be lost, it can only be increased. \n The Superior Man acts with clarity by accurately evaluating cause and effect. [Or: The objective assessment of any contradiction is the road to comprehending it.] \n The fifty-fifth hexagram is very intriguing in that it appears to have a misleading title in the original Chinese, which is usually translated as Abundance,Fullness, Prosperity, etc. All of the internal clues, plus empirical experience with the figure have convinced me that the title Expansion of Awareness is a more accurate description of the forces operating in this hexagram. Here is my reasoning: \nFirst, the component trigrams of Clarity and Movement portray action directed by clear comprehension, as well as awareness itself in motion or expansion. The title of Abundance seems misleading because it suggests a relatively static condition, whereas the combined trigrams in the figure symbolize Clear Movement. These trigrams appear in reverse sequence in hexagram number twenty-one, Discernment, which symbolizes the act of comprehending -- a dynamic function of consciousness described in the Image here as a quest for justice: \"Thus the superior man decides lawsuits and carries out punishments.\" (Wilhelm) Notice also that the message for the superior man in this Image is almost identical with that in Discernment:\"Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws through clearly defined penalties.\" (Wilhelm) The ancient kings can always be taken as symbolic of archetypal forces (the \"gods\"), so their laws are those of nature, not of humankind. Interpreted broadly, both messages counsel us to: \"Comprehend the law of Tao, or suffer the penalties of ignorance.\" Which is to say: \"expand your awareness.\" \nSecond, note the message in the Judgment. Most of the translators render this by comparing the king at the peak of his power with the sun at the peak of its illumination at noon. The sun is the symbol of clarity and enlightenment, and the sun at its zenith therefore symbolizes a high point of awareness. \nThird, notice that lines two, three and four depict an eclipse of the sun through its waxing, full and waning phases. This suggests ignorance gradually evolving toward comprehension, which is finally attained in line five. The progression in the hexagram is from ignorance to clarity, and then in line six, ignorance within clarity -- i.e., an image of one who remains obtuse while surrounded by the light of illumination. \nFourth, the combined trigrams of shock and light (thunder and lightning) suggest a sudden and numinous illumination: the sort of en-light-enment (expansion of awareness) described by Yogis: \n\n\n Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light entering my brain through the spinal cord ... The illumination grew brighter and brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light ... I was no longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small point of awareness confined in a body, but instead was a vast circle of consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state of exaltation and happiness impossible to describe. \nGopi Krishna --Kundalini, the Evolutionary Energy in Man \n\n\n It is possible that the written character translated into English as Abundance has these associations in Chinese. Unfortunately, the title of Abundance itself does not immediately suggest in the English language the ideas that are integral in the symbolism of the hexagram.",

His correlate is the dynamic fourth line, which would normally be deemed unfortunate.

Mutual helpfulness is required for continued prosperity. \n Wing:  Associating with someone whose goals are similar to your own will now bring you clarity and energy. It is not a mistake to continue in this close relationship until the project is complete. \n Editor: For two yang lines to be in proper correlation seems to contradict the logic upon which theI Ching is founded, yet in this specific instance it is deemed correct. The image suggests the affinity of similar principles or categories. The Confucian commentary may be interpreted to mean that they remain united only to the extent that they are in accord. To make more or less out of the situation than the analogy warrants is to break the connection and lose the truth. Psychologically interpreted, the line can suggest a close connection between ego and Self. \n\n\n Maturity and development demand a confrontation of the ego and the Self. The necessary adaptation of the ego is challenged by the Self's urge for the ego\u2019s transformation. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest \n\n A.

Blofeld: Presently people's trust will help us to accomplish our will. Ritsema/Karcher:  Trustworthiness using shooting-forth purpose indeed. Cleary (2): Expressing sincerity means expressing intention truthfully. Wu: Sincerity can change the impressions of others. \n Legge: The magnetic second line is in her correct place in the center of the lower trigram of Clarity. Her ruler is the magnetic and incorrect fifth line whose ignorance doesn't recognize line two's intelligence. If two tries to advance she won't be acceptable to the ruler, and will not be employed. The only way to be useful under such circumstances is to sincerely develop her inner light until it is recognized.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  Intrigues have put a barrier between the chief executive desiring great works and the man capable of bringing them about. The courtiers have usurped the ruler's power. The man should not take energetic action, which will only lead to suspicion and dislike. He must depend upon his sincere devotion to move the ruler's mind in a less obvious way. \n Wing: You lack influence in regard to the object of your interest. Obstacles not of your own making stand in the way of your progress. If you attempt to push ahead, you will invite envy and suspicion. There is a possibility of a fortunate outcome only if you are continuously sincere and truthful. Then your influence may reach. \n Editor:  The image of screens so thick that the stars can be seen at noon is psychologically an eclipse of consciousness by ignorance. The answer or solution is available, but you or someone involved in the matter at hand doesn't see it. Sometimes the line can hint at an estrangement between ego and Self beyond our ability to understand at the moment. \n\n\n Never in any circumstances should one indulge in the unscientific illusion that one's own subjective prejudice is a universal and fundamental psychological truth. No true science can spring from this, only a faith whose shadow is intolerance and fanaticism. Contradictory views are necessary for the evolution of any science, only they must not be set up in rigid opposition to each other but should strive for the earliest possible synthesis. \nJung -- The Symbolic Life\n\n A. Clarity is obscured by ignorance and mistrust. Intelligence unrecognized is intelligence unused. Allow the situation to develop until the way becomes clear. \n B. It is not always possible to understand what is taking place below the threshold of awareness -- hold to the precepts of the Work when you are uncertain of your role."

But he remains free of error. \n Wing: Incompetence is at its Zenith. Be patient. \n Editor:  Midday is noon -- normally the zenith of illumination, and hence symbolic of awareness or truth. Here however, a condition equivalent to a full solar eclipse is portrayed. (The exact opposite of the position of the king in the Judgment.) The \"small Mei star\" is a distant sun, a lesser light: symbolically, a feeble comprehension. Darkness is ignorance, and the right arm represents one's power or ability to act. Blofeld, Liu, Ritsema/Karcher and Cleary (2) state that rain or \"froth\" is screening the light -- a hint that emotion may be clouding clear perception. (Water symbolizes the emotional realm.) These somewhat confused images nevertheless all agree that clear choice is eclipsed by ignorance: you are essentially powerless, and should refrain from significant action.\n\n\n I am an empiricist, not a philosopher; I cannot let myself presuppose that my peculiar temperament, my own attitude to intellectual problems, is universally valid. Apparently this is an assumption in which only the philosopher may indulge, who always takes it for granted that his own disposition and attitude are universal, and will not recognize the fact, if he can avoid it, that his \"personal equation\" conditions his philosophy. \nJung -- The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious \n\n A.

That this is \"a screen to her household\u201d tells us that important aspects of the situation are unrecognized: She \"can't see the trees for the forest.\u201d Legge's \"still\u201d door is a portal closed to awareness. In short, because of self-chosen isolation, she doesn't take advantage of an abundance of unperceived opportunities. A hermit\u2019s life of renunciation may bring about an expansion of awareness, but it is wasted if one does not take appropriate action in the world. Ironically, the hexagram created when this is the only changing line is number 30, Clarity, offering a clear image of what she is missing in life. \n\n\n Communication must be radiation and receiving and exchange. Whenever irritation is involved, then we are not able to see properly and fully and clearly the spacious quality of that which is coming toward us, that which is presenting itself as communication. The external world is immediately rejected by our irritation which says, \u201cNo, no, this irritates me, go away.\u201d Such an attitude is the complete opposite of transcendental generosity. So the bodhisattva must experience the complete communication of generosity, transcending irritation and self-defensiveness. Otherwise, when thorns threaten to prick us, we feel that we are being attacked, that we must defend ourselves. We run away from the tremendous opportunity for communication that has been given to us, and we have not been brave enough even to look to the other shore of the river. We are looking back and trying to run away. \nChogyam Trungpa \n\n A. You are out of touch with reality -- blind to the light which surrounds you, too myopic to see your options. \n\n June 10, 2001, 4/25/06"

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In the marriage of a young bride the proper relationship between heaven and earth is seen. Nothing could grow or flourish if heaven and earth did not unite. The marriage of a young bride is therefore both the commencement and goal of humanity. But here the desire of pleasure employs movement to attain union. This action will be evil because the lines are in inappropriate places, and the magnetic three and five are mounted on dynamic lines.",
        "Legge": "The Chinese phrase for this hexagram might be equivalent to the English \"giving in marriage,\u201d but there are some special meanings in this case which must be understood. The Judgment gives a bad auspice because the trigram of the Youngest Daughter is beneath the trigram of the Eldest Son. Since the action of the hexagram begins with the lowest trigram, we have two violations of propriety. First, the marriage is initiated by the woman and her friends. She goes unilaterally to her future home instead of the bridegroom coming to fetch her. Second, the parties are unequally matched -- there is too great a disparity in their ages. In addition, all the lines in the hexagram except the top and the bottom are in places inappropriate for them. Some commentators insist that the symbol of the contracting of a marriage in this hexagram sets forth some principles which should obtain in the relation between a ruler and his ministers. \n The growth of things in nature from the interaction of heaven and earth is analogous to the increase of mankind through the interaction between male and female in marriage. The K'ang-hsi editors reconcile this good auspice with the unfavorable Judgment by saying: \"The interaction of the yin and yang cannot be dispensed with, but we ought to be careful about it in the beginning in order to prevent mischief in the end.\u201d The error here is that the desire for the marriage originated with the lady, and that she is heedless of the disparity in their ages."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Propriety means that unilateral action is inappropriate. \n The Superior Man understands that the Work is guided from within, and that choices which ignore this truth can only retard its progress. (Present actions originate future consequences: pay heed to your choices.) \n The traditional name for this hexagram is The Marrying Maiden -- a title which does not convey to modern western readers the subtlety of its symbolism. Blofeld says: \"This hexagram is, on the whole, a most unfortunate omen ... We must not suppose that it deals only with marriage. What is said about the maiden symbolizes in some way or other what we may expect for ourselves within the context of our enquiry.\" The figure is certainly difficult, but \"unfortunate\" only if its import is resisted or denied: any portrayal of our situation which eliminates illusion (however painful the realization), must be regarded as a positive lesson. \n Although the Confucian commentary describes this hexagram in terms of self-seeking aspiration, the wretched protagonist of the figure is not invariably culpable, and neither Judgment nor Image imply this. In addition to being at the very bottom of the social pecking order, the maiden is portrayed as half-blind, crippled and a \"slave.\" Although condemned by the commentators for importuning a marriage that would raise her status, a close reading of the lines reveals that only the sixth place suggests possible impropriety -- the others all contain advice about how one of extremely low status should cope with restricted circumstances. The hexagram therefore can deal with either of two possible conditions: those involving Proprietyand those involving Making-do as an adaptation to adversity. \n In the first instance, it is useful to compare the symbolism here with that of the preceding hexagram of Gradual Progress. There we see the organic progression of the Work allegorized as the proper marriage of a young woman. In this case, Gradual Progress has been turned upside down and the symbolism reversed: this young woman improperly pursues a marriage on her own initiative. Psychologically interpreted, it can be regarded as an image of the ego pushing its own agenda or desire for union. \n\n\n The ego may move in directions and toward actions that are at variance with the intentions and standards of the Self ... The mature adult needs to recognize eventually his or her relative limitedness vis-\u00e0-vis the \"Self- field\" and the cosmic organism of which s/he is but a cell. We are subject to the ordering and growth intents of the entelechy of the whole.\nE. C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing \n\n\n To recognize our `relative limitedness \u201cvis-\u00e0-vis the Self-field\u201d is to renounce our claim to unilateral action. Though the ego ardently desires a marriage with the Self, only the Self can initiate such a union. Chou Tun I, an early Neo-Confucian, makes an observation which illuminates Legge's Image: \n\n\n \"The superior man, in accordance with this, having regard to the far-distant end, knows the mischief that may be done at the beginning. The most important things in the world are tendencies. Tendencies may be strong or weak. If a tendency is extremely strong, it cannot be controlled. But it is possible to control it quickly if one realizes that it is strong. To control it requires effort. If one does not realize early enough, it will not be easy to apply effort.\u201d \n\n\n To receive this hexagram without changing lines can be an admonition to examine your motives and actions in the matter at hand. Where are you out of line? If no obvious impropriety is involved, it could also portray an essentially impotent predicament. At such times Ritsema/Karcher's synopsis bears repetition: \"This hexagram describes your situation in terms of the changing status of someone who cannot control their circumstances. It emphasizes that finding a real field of activity through accepting this imposition is the adequate way to handle it.\u201d \n\u00a0\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION \n Compare Propriety with hexagram number fifty-three, Gradual Progress, then compare them both with hexagram number thirty-one,Initiative.  What are the similarities in their ideas? Now look at hexagrams number eleven, seventeen and twenty-two and observe the over-all philosophy which begins to emerge.",

Wilhelm/Baynes: \"The marrying maiden as a concubine,\u201d because that gives duration. \"A lame man who is able to tread...,\u201d because they receive each other. Blofeld: What is described in the first sentence was due to her constancy; the second sentence presages mutual support. Ritsema/Karcher: Using persevering indeed. Mutualizing receiving indeed. Cleary (2): The lame can walk to good fortune because of service. Wu: It is auspicious because they have roles to play. \n Legge: A feudal prince was said to marry nine ladies at once. The principal of them was the bride who was to be the proper wife, and she was attended by two others, virgins from her father's harem; a cousin and a half-sister, a daughter of her father by another mother of inferior rank. Under line one the young woman of the hexagram appears in the inferior position of this half-sister. But the line is dynamic, indicative of a female of firm virtue. The mean condition and its duties are to be deplored, and give the auspice of lameness; but notwithstanding, the secondary wife will in a measure discharge her service. There will be good fortune. \n Notwithstanding apparent disadvantages, an able officer may do his ruler good service. \"It is the constant practice for such a case\" in the Confucian commentary seems to mean that an ancillary wife has no right to the disposition of herself, but must do what she is told. Thus it is that the mean position of the younger sister does not interfere with the service that she can render.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man in a relatively low position enjoys the confidence of the prince. Outwardly, he keeps tactfully behind the official ministers. Although this diminishes his status, he continues to perform valuable services for the state. \n Wing: Your position within the situation is low in stature, but you have the good fortune of being taken into the confidence of a superior. If you remain Subordinate, you will assure your security. You can then influence the situation using tact and reserve. \n Editor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender designation employed in this book. Generally speaking, the line should be read as symbolic of any situation in which one is in a subordinate, powerless position. Often it suggests the need for some sort of compromise in the situation at hand. \n\n\n In that game of interaction which the ego plays with the objective psyche, it appears as if the cards were dealt by the unconscious, since it is the unconscious which gives rise to and shapes the strength or weakness of the ego. The ego's responsibility is to do the best that it can with the hand it is dealt. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest \n\n A. An image of making do with what you have. Get by as best you can. \n B.

It is much more needful to teach people the art of seeing. For it is obvious that far too many people are incapable of establishing a connection between the sacred figures and their own psyche: they cannot see to what extent the equivalent images are lying dormant in their own unconscious. In order to facilitate this inner vision we must first clear the way for the faculty of seeing. How this is to be done without psychology, that is, without making contact with the psyche, is, frankly, beyond my comprehension. \nJung -- Psychology and Alchemy\n\n A.

To accomplish this you must overcome vanity, pride, and any ostentatious behavior. To Subordinate yourself to others, regardless of their position, is now a good thing. \n Editor: It is instructive to compare this line with the fifth line of hexagram number eleven,Harmony, which also refers to King Ti-yi's younger sister. A clue to the symbolism comes from the Neo-Confucian classic, The Doctrine of the Mean: \n The Book of Odes says, \"Over her brocaded robe, she wore a plain and simple dress,\u201d for she disliked the loudness of its color and patterns. Thus the way of the superior man is hidden but becomes more prominent every day, whereas the way of the inferior man is conspicuous but gradually disappears. It is characteristic of the superior man to be plain, and yet people do not get tired of him. He is simple and yet rich in cultural adornment. He is amiable and yet systematically methodical. He knows what is distant begins with what is near. He knows where the winds (moral influence) come from. And he knows the subtle will be manifested. Such a man can enter into virtue. \n We see here a princess-bride who is less attractively arrayed than her bridesmaid, and a waxing moon which has yet to reach full illumination. The context of the line is a royal marriage -- the hieros gamos or holy marriage of the alchemists which is also described in hexagram number eleven. Psychologically, the image can suggest that during a time when forces are coming together for synthesis, less important elements in the situation may seem more attractive than the true essence. Since the moon isn't full yet, we haven't seen all of the light -- full comprehension has yet to dawn. Sometimes the line simply boils down to the idea that \"things are not what they seem.\u201d \n\n\n It should also be pointed out that the reaching up into the realm of the super-conscious and its exploration, while approaching the consciousness of the Self, may sometimes even constitute an obstacle to full Self- realization, to the reaching of the summit where the personal-I awareness blends into awareness of the spiritual Self. One can become so fascinated by the wonders of the super-conscious realm, so absorbed in it, so identified with some of its special aspects or manifestations as to lose or paralyze the urge to reach the summit of Self-realization. \nRoberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis\n\n A. \"You can't see the forest for the trees.\" The truth is hidden by distracting elements, but in the fullness of time it will be revealed.

The parties concerned offer sacrifices in the temple, but the woman's basket is empty and the man's effort is fruitless. \n Cleary (2): When one does not accumulate virtue in life, then one has no spirit after death and cannot cause one\u2019s descendants to flourish. Developed people, knowing what is wrong by thinking of the lasting results, see this at the outset.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man goes through superficial actions, such as offering an empty basket and a pre-slaughtered sheep to the gods, solely to preserve the form. This disregard for content bodes no good for lasting associations. \n Wing:  Are you just going through the motions? Is there content to the refined manner you present? If you are acting out of adherence to form, don't bother. Nothing will come of it. \n Editor:  Like everything else in the Book of Changes, this line can symbolize an enormous range of situations. At its most basic level, a union of opposites does not take place. Whether or not blame is involved depends upon the circumstances. Note that blame is not mentioned in the line itself. \n Sacrifices, charities and penances performed without faith in the Supreme are nonpermanent. O son of Prtha, they are useless both in this life and in the next. \nBhagavad-Gita 17: 28 \n\n A. An empty sacrifice, a fruitless offering, wasted effort. \n B. A missed connection or fruitless union -- any further striving would be a waste of energy. \n C. \"Don't cast your pearls before swine.\" \n D. An image of hypocrisy of some sort. \n\n June 30, 2002, 4/25/06"

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Persona we see the magnetic central line ornamenting the dynamic lines of the lower trigram, and hence it is said that ornament should have free course. On the other hand, the dynamic top line ornaments the magnetic lines of the upper trigram, and hence it is said that there will be little advantage if ornament is allowed to advance and take the lead. The elegance and intelligence of the lower trigram is regulated by the restraint of the upper trigram. This suggests the observances which adorn human society. We observe the ornamental figures of the sky, and thereby ascertain the changes of the seasons. We observe the ceremonial customs of society, and understand how transformation is accomplished in the world.",
        "Legge": "Persona is the symbol of what is ornamental and of the act of adorning. As there is adornment in nature, so should there be in society, but its place is secondary to that which is substantial. \n The K'ang-hsi editors say that the magnetic line coming and ornamenting the two dynamic lines in the lower trigram shows how substantiality should have the benefit of ornamentation. The dynamic line ornamenting the two magnetic lines in the upper trigram shows how ornamentation should be restrained by substantiality. Ornament has its use, but it should be kept in check. \n The figures of the sky are all the heavenly bodies in their relative positions and various movements, producing day and night, heat and cold, etc. The observances of society are the ceremonies and performances which regulate and beautify the intercourse of men. \n \"A mountain,\" says Ch'eng-tzu, \"is a place where we find grass, trees, and a hundred other things. A fire burning below it throws up its light, and brings them all out in beauty. This gives the idea of ornament, or being ornamented. The various processes of government are small matters, and elegance and ornament help their course, but great matters of judgment demand the simple, unadorned truth.\u201d"

    "Notes": "Judgment: There's nothing wrong with showing a little style, but don't become so identified with a role that it makes your decisions for you. \n The Superior Man  displays wit and charm when that is appropriate, but relies upon shrewd discernment when making serious choices. \n Confucius points out the correct attitude for this hexagram in his third sentence -- the elegant intelligence, or \"brilliant wit\" of the lower trigram is being \"sat on\" by the mountain of the upper trigram. Brilliant wit is often just an \"ornament\" to make one look clever in the company of others. Like seasoning on food, a little bit ofPersona or ornamentation is life-enhancing, but too much curry powder overwhelms the meal. \n Jung's conception of the Persona points out the fact that it is a major vehicle for the complexes to express themselves under the guise of social interaction: \n\n\n (The Persona) is only a mask for the collective psyche, a mask that feigns individuality, and tries to make others and oneself believe that one is individual, whereas one is simply playing a part in which the collective psyche speaks.\n Jung -- The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious\n\n\n For an urban shipping clerk to wear cowboy clothes may be a legitimate expression of his personality, or it may be the only outlet available for repressed portions of his psyche. When he begins driving a pickup truck and frequenting Country-Western bars we might suspect that his role is playing him and the real Self is being masked by excessive ornamentation orPersona.\n\n\n The person cannot be more than an instrument for the manifestation of the self. But people get so attached to their mask that they cannot free themselves from it any more ... They make a king out of the servant and separate themselves from their true being. They force their higher self into exile, into the unconscious.\nElisabeth Haich --Initiation\n\n\n To receive this hexagram without changing lines suggests that perhaps you are more focused on form than meaning, or that superficial appearances are concealing something more substantive in the situation.

It is merely an adornment. If you pay more attention to the vessel than to what it contains, you will entirely miss the meaning of this moment. \n Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): Nothing in itself should be cultivated that is not somehow prepared to subordinate itself to meaning. \n Editor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. In my experience neither the Siu nor Wing paraphrases reflect the deeper meaning of this line. Note that Wilhelm's \"paraphrase\" from his Lectures on the I Chingis not exactly analogous to either of them. In his regular commentary he states: \"The third line is the chin and the second is, as it were, merely its appendage. The upward movement that evokes grace takes place in the two lines together. The yielding element can adorn the strong, but cannot add to it an independent quality. This line has significance only in the hexagram taken as a whole; in its individual aspect it is not especially important. (pg 497)\u201d The beard, an \"ornament\" which conceals the chin which shapes it, suggests the concept of the Persona: The mask that hides the face is analogous to the beard that hides the chin. As suggested by Blofeld's note on the Confucian commentary, in some situations the line can assume a meaning analogous to Matthew 22:21 -- \"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's\u201d or even: \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\" (There are times when the Work could be harmed if unprotected by a facade.) \n\n\n We have to become aware of ourselves as individuals; apart from the external demands made upon us, we have to acquire a sense of responsibility and a capacity for judgment which are not necessarily identical with external collective expectations and standards, though of course these standards must be given due regard. We have to discover that we use our representational clothes for protection and appearance but that we can also change into something more comfortable when it is appropriate and can be naked at other times. If our clothes stick to us or seem to replace our skin we are likely to be come ill. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest\n\n A. Form follows function. \n B. You are only an appendage to a larger reality. Follow what is best in you. \n C. Sometimes it is necessary for the substantive to be concealed by the trivial. \n D.

Following Wilhelm's insight (see his commentary on the preceding line), that the second and third places in this hexagram are closely interdependent, a Jungian interpretation of their alliance suggests itself: line 2 being the Persona and line 3 being the Ego through which it acts as conditions require.

One is the path of adornment and external brilliance; the other is the path of simplicity and inner worth. Your considerations suggest a deeper connection with your true Self. The path of simplicity will lead to more meaningful relationships with others and greater self-knowledge. \n Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): Here is the point where life is silent for a moment, and now the decision must be made how to continue shaping life. \n Editor: There are three main ideas here -- first, the idea of being \"adorned in white.\" Clothing symbolizes the opinions and attitudes which \"adorn\" our personality. To be dressed in white therefore, is to be simple and unpretentious \u2013 the opposite of complexity and ostentation. \n Second , the image of a flying white horse. This suggests purified (white) psychic energy (horsepower) united with the wings of intellectual aspiration. Wings enable entities to fly in the air -- symbolically, the realm of thought. We are immediately reminded of Pegasus, and although we can assume that the Duke of Chou knew nothing of Pegasus, the symbolic associations are not irrelevant here. Pegasus is associated in Greek mythology with the Muses -- the sources of creativity and inspiration. \n The third idea is of marriage -- the conjunction of masculine and feminine in a holy union or hieros gamos: the creative synthesis of thought and feeling within the psyche. However, the suitor can't unite with the subject of the line until all confusion has been eliminated from the situation. He is perceived as a \"robber\" because the barriers to union must be removed (\"stolen\") before the alliance can take place: in other words, an illusion prevails. \n This line (and indeed the entire hexagram) is often received in answer to questions concerning creativity or the creative process. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number thirty, Clarity. \n\n\n I discriminate between the ordinary ego-consciousness of the man and his creative personality. Very often there is a striking difference. Personally a creative man can be an introvert, but in his work he is an extravert and vice versa. \nJung -- Letters\n\n A. You don't understand the matter at hand. Unseen forces are working toward unity however, and clarity will eventually dawn. \n B. The image suggests the gestation of a creative idea. \n C.

However, your internal desires and sincere feelings of friendliness are all that truly matter. Your worth will be recognized and you will meet with good fortune. \n Wilhelm  (from Lectures on the I Ching): Thus Tao and law are also found where man, the personal element, the human mask, as it were, is no longer visible. \n Editor:  The theme of Persona here contrasts \u201csimplicity\u201d with Haute Couture \u2013 I visualize a ragged Taoist sage in the emperor\u2019s palace garden. Stingy, small, meager, plain, ragged, parsimonious, all suggest some sort of impoverishment. To be \u201cadorned\u201d by \u201cpoverty\u201d can suggest a morally superior but weak position in relationship to a strong one: the intimidating \u201chills and gardens\u201d of the aristocracy which define the situation. Thus: your position is weak but correct and should prevail if you serve the Tao. There is also the idea of a small but sincere sacrifice which brings an eventual reward in excess of the original offering. The alliance with the top line suggests a connection with superior forces from whom, despite our humble station, we are adorned via our inner grace. \n\n\n [Jesus] sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in a great deal. A poor widow came and put in two small coins, the equivalent of a penny. Then he called his disciples and said to them, \"I tell you solemnly, this poor widow has put more in than all who have contributed to the treasury; for they have all put in money they had over, but she from the little she has put in everything she possessed, all she had to live on.\" \nMark 12: 41-44 \n\n A.

We are reminded of the difference between unity and multiplicity -- unity being one simple whole, multiplicity being many diverse complexities or \"ornaments.\" \n\n\n Only the truly intelligent understand this principle of the leveling of all things into One. They discard the distinctions and take refuge in the common and ordinary things. The common and ordinary things serve certain functions and therefore retain the wholeness of nature. From this wholeness, one comprehends, and from comprehension, one comes near to Tao. There one stops. To stop without knowing how one stops -- this is Tao. \nChuangtse \n\n A. \"Keep it simple.\" \n\n June 28, 2002, 4/23/06, 3/14/08"

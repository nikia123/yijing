        "Confucius/Legge": "Excess is weakly supported at either end, with weakness in both the lowest and topmost lines. The dynamic lines are in excess, but two of them are in the central positions. The trigrams of Flexibility and Satisfaction indicate that there will be advantage in moving in any direction whatever -- there will be success. Great indeed is the work to be done during this extraordinary time.",
        "Legge": "Extraordinary times require extraordinary skill in their management. The figure shows two magnetic lines at top and bottom, with four dynamic lines between them -- giving the image of a great beam unable to sustain its own weight. Lines two and five are both dynamic and central however, and from this and the attributes of the component trigrams a good auspice is obtained."

    "Notes": "Judgment:  A stressful situation is best managed with a comprehensive strategy. (Or: in the chess game of life, one succeeds by planning several moves in advance.) \n The Superior Man  serves The Work by going his own way, regardless of public opinion. \n Wilhelm titles this hexagram Preponderance of the Great. I prefer R.L. Wing's paraphrase of Critical Massas more evocative of the figure's meaning in modern terminology. \n In Critical Mass four dynamic lines lurk inside of the hexagram, weakly contained at top and bottom by two magnetic lines. This energetic concentration could explode in an unpredictable release of force, and hence the Judgment tells us to move now (remember: non-action is also action) to avoid unwanted consequences. (Often the outcome is predictable \u2013 be prepared to just walk away if and when that is your best move.) \n Legge\u2019s translation of the Judgment is: \n\n\n \"...It is advantageous to move in any direction whatever. \" \n\n\n This is a different message than Wilhelm's: \n\n\n \"...It furthers one to have somewhere to go.\" \n\n\n Legge\u2019s version implies an almost hysterical flight from danger while Wilhelm's rendition suggests prior intention and planning. The latter interpretation is definitely what is meant here, as confirmed by Cleary\u2019s Buddhist commentary: \n\n\n When the transformative path is flourishing, contaminations easily arise; it is best to set up guidelines and regulations. When meditation work is advanced, ignorance is about to dissolve; it is best to exercise the mind skillfully. \n\n\n Coupled with Cleary\u2019s translation of the Image as: \u201cDeveloped people stand alone without fear, avoid society without distress,\u201d the idea is that one should follow one's best intuition and ignore popular illusions, political correctness or inner fears. (Psychologically: conventional thinking, socially conditioned reflexes, knee-jerk responses, etc.). During a time of Critical Mass, pay close attention to direction from the Self to preserve the Work. This is not the time to follow the crowd. Sometimes this can mean that you are obliged to go it alone \u2013 one of the Work\u2019s frequent tests (Cf. line 6): \n\n\n The Gulf is something that has to be leaped, and leaped alone, stripped of all hindering burdens, in faith ... It is thus one of the crisis points of spiritual progress because of the great temptation to turn back from the unknown to the apparent safety of known things, and to succumb to this temptation is to lose all the fruits of past endeavor. \nG. Knight -- A Practical Guide to Kabbalistic Symbolism\n\n\n\u00a0\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION \n Compare the Judgment and Image of this hexagram with those of hexagram number 32, Consistency. \n Anthony:  We must regain modesty through the effort to rid ourself of strong elements that cause us to press forward. The strong elements may exist in someone else, causing them to assault us with their fear, mistrust or doubt. Strong refers to impetuous movement to resolve what is ambiguous \u2026 We can meet the challenge by remaining detached and letting things go through their changes \u2026 To be truly rich is to remain modest; to be truly powerful is to remain reticent.",

Wu: Because the meek is in the low position. \n The Master said: To place the things on the ground might be considered sufficient; but when one places mats of the white grass beneath them, what occasion for blame can there be? Such a course shows the height of carefulness. The white grass is a trivial thing, but through the use made of it, it may become important. One who goes forward using such careful art will not fall into any error.\n Legge:  The first line is magnetic, at the bottom of both the hexagram and the lower trigram of Humility or Flexibility. Therefore she is distinguished by carefulness, as in the matter mentioned, and there is a good auspice.",

The times are indeed extraordinary, and you must be particularly careful to proceed in the right way. Being overcautious is not a mistake. \n Editor: The idea is to lay a careful foundation for any enterprise to prevent later instability. Make careful choices now to prevent evil consequences later on. \n\n\n Don't you know that the beginning is the most important part of every work and that this is especially so with anything young and tender?

Cleary (2): (He) has her for a companion in spite of being older.

This way you are in the company of persons who can understand and share the enthusiasm of your goals. Things will move smoothly and the situation will become revitalized. \n Editor:  The trigram for Wood beneath the trigram for a Lake or Marsh suggests the idea of a tree that grows near water, hence: a willow tree. Whether dry, withered, decayed or bitter, this old tree experiences an unexpected renewal of life. The elderly husband and young wife are a different metaphor for the same idea, and the symbolism can sometimes refer to a union of thought and feeling. Psychologically implicit is the idea of intellect as mentor and guide to emotional responses: an archetypal relationship. \n\n\n In such dream wanderings one frequently encounters an old man who is accompanied by a young girl, and examples of such couples are to be found in many mythic tales. \nJung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections\n\n A.

His duty is to meet the extraordinary exigency of the time. Although dynamic, he is in a magnetic place and his strength is tempered -- he will be equal to his task.

Do not rely upon people or things outside of your Self for guidance. Dependence now on external things leads to humiliation. \n Editor:  This is one of those maddening lines of which every translator renders a subtly different version. Some aren't even internally consistent: Legge's translation says that there will be cause for regret if the subject \"looks for other help but that of line one,\u201d which I take to mean: \"Only line one is the proper source of assistance.\u201d Inexplicably, his exposition then cautions against such assistance, as does his Confucian commentary. Blofeld's version is a tautology effectively removing serious warning from the line. The Wilhelm and Liu translations are least confusing and imply that we are protected as long as we suppress our lower impulses and maintain allegiance to a higher principle. In my experience, this interpretation has been most accurate. \n\n\n The patient must be alone if he is to find out what it is that supports him when he can no longer support himself.

        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge:  A decayed willow produces flowers, but how can this secure its long continuance? An old wife and a young husband is also a thing to be ashamed of. Wilhelm/Baynes: How could this last long? It is nevertheless a disgrace. Blofeld: How can such blossom endure for long? From another point of view, both of them should feel ashamed. [The question of blaming or praising such a marriage is in any case of little importance, since it can scarcely be destined to endure for long. The second sentence of the commentary perhaps reveals that, for once, Confucius was inclined to disagree with his beloved mentor, the Book of Change, and to be taken aback by the words \"no blame.\" From the point of view of divination, lines of this sort do not always indicate marriage; this line could mean that we shall do or have done something rather unusual of which the results will be more or less negative.] Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore permitting lasting indeed? Truly permitting the demoniac indeed. Cleary (2): How can they last? (It) can also be embarrassing. Wu: How long can it last? (They) make an awkward couple. \n Legge:  Line five is dynamic and central and should be able to achieve extraordinary merit. But he has no proper correlate below, and as line two is inclined to line one, so is line five inclined to line six. But here the willow only produces flowers, not shoots -- its decay will soon reappear. An old wife will have no children. If the line is not to be condemned like line three, neither does his action deserve praise. The shoots produced in line two will grow into a new and vigorous tree, but here the flowers will soon decay, and the withered trunk continue the same. For what will a young man marry an old woman? There will be no children; it can only be from some mercenary motive.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  Notwithstanding promising potentialities the man gives up his alliances with the people below him and seeks the company only of those of higher rank. An unstable arrangement results. Instead of greater security, there will be less. No renewal occurs after the flower saps the tree's remaining energy. \n Wing: In critical or significant times it is exhausting to cling to your ideals and ignore the realities of your environment. These realities are the superstructure that supports your life. If you ignore your foundations in your reach upward, you will become unstable and accomplish nothing at all. \n Editor:  Notice that the original line says that there will be neither praise nor blame. It is the Confucian commentary, written many hundreds of years later, that attaches the idea of \"shame\u201d to this position. Following Confucius, Blofeld's footnote also interprets the results as negative: but this is not really warranted from the line itself. The image is a reasonable portrayal of an inconclusive, fruitless or trivial situation. The condition emblemed is one of marking time: marching in place. Psychologically interpreted, the wife can symbolize an emotional component of the psyche: a desire or feeling; the husband would be a mental component: perhaps discrimination. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes number thirty-two: Consistency, with a corresponding line that confirms the ineffectual condition. \n\n\n While man is a soul in essence he may, while incarnate in flesh, forget his real origins and indeed live out his whole existence in an animal  [like] or vegetable [like] consciousness. \nZ.B.S.

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Joy has the meaning of Pleased Satisfaction. We have the dynamic lines in the center and the magnetic lines on the outer edge of the two trigrams, indicating that in pleasure what is most advantageous is the maintenance of firm correctness. Through this there will be found an accordance with the will of heaven, and a correspondence with the feelings of men. When such pleasure goes before the people, and leads them on, they forget their toils; when it animates them in encountering difficulties, they forget the risk of death. How great is the power of this Pleased Satisfaction, stimulating in such a way the people!",
        "Legge": "The feeling of pleasure is the subject of this hexagram, which is made up of the doubled trigram of Cheerfulness, or Pleased Satisfaction. The progress and attainment of the figure are due to the one magnetic line surmounting each trigram and supported by the two dynamic lines. The idea is that of mildness which is energized by a double portion of strength. \n The pleasure which leads the people to endure toil and risk death is the effect of the instructive example of their ruler. Fu Fan-hsien paraphrases this portion of the text as: \"When the sage with this precedes them, he can make them endure toil without any wish to decline it, and go with him into difficulty and danger without their having any fear.\" \n Anthony:  This hexagram speaks, on the one hand, of that on which true joy depends, and on the other, of joy as desire, which leads to conflict. The essence of true joy is inner stability. Being firmly devoted to our path, we do not waver. When we think of the soft and comfortable path, on the other hand, self-conflict begins. Therefore, getting this hexagram indicates that we may be wavering or irresolute."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: A cheerful attitude serves the will. \n The Superior Man shares his thoughts and feelings. [Or, psychologically interpreted: observes, weighs and integrates his thoughts with his feelings.]\n The title of this hexagram denotes joyousness and pleasure, and most people regard it as a good omen when they receive it. Yet, an analysis of the lines indicates that only the first two are particularly favorable, and the hexagram itself seldom seems to refer to anything remotely resembling \u201cJoy\u201d in a typical oracle consultation. The lessons to be learned from the figure are the differences between self-indulgence and maintaining emotional stability in one's conduct of the Work, which always demands a firm control over one\u2019s affects. To receive this hexagram without changing lines requires the querent's careful discrimination -- it can mean simply: \"Oh happy day!\" Or, it can suggest that you examine an inclination toward lack of control in the situation at hand. The oracle is capable of brutal sarcasm when your query warrants it, so don't be too quick to accept the shallow meaning ofJoy \u2013 as often as not, Self-indulgence is the more appropriate title. \n\n\n In light frivolity, the center is lost; in hasty action, self-mastery is lost. \nLao Tse \n\n\n The Image depicts an open interchange among \u201cfriends.\u201d Intrapsychically, this suggests the normal give and take between thoughts and feelings for the purpose of reaching integration. The symbol of \u201ctwo bodies of water conjoined\u201d (Blofeld) might refer to the adjacent dimensions of thought and emotion within the psyche. When feelings are not in harmony with intellectual differentiation (a common phenomenon), give and take (\u201cdiscussion and practice\u201d), is essential to effect integration: i.e., harmony, or \u201cjoy.\u201d\"Practice\" suggests cycles of time, and the notion that perfection is still to be achieved. \n Shaughnessy\u2019s seemingly anomalous title of Usurpation for this hexagram offers some subtle insights into the symbolism here. Emotions, feelings, affects, are often portrayed as daemonic forces which \u201cusurp\u201d ego consciousness and indulge themselves in the \u201cjoy\u201d of expressing whatever they happen to represent in the psyche. This is often what is implied when receiving this hexagram. \n\n\n Each of us is equipped with a psychic disposition that limits our freedom in high degree and makes it practically illusory. Not only is \"freedom of the will\" an incalculable problem philosophically, it is also a misnomer in the practical sense, for we seldom find anybody who is not influenced and indeed dominated by desires, habits, impulses, prejudices, resentments, and by every conceivable kind of complex. All these natural facts function exactly like an Olympus full of deities who want to be propitiated, served, feared and worshipped, not only by the individual owner of this assorted pantheon, but by everybody in his vicinity. \nJung -- Psychology and Religion \n\n\n Cleary\u2019s Taoist commentary: \u201cAs water provides moisture for myriad beings, etc.,\u201d supports this interpretation. Water symbolizes the emotional realm, and the \u201cmyriad beings\u201d dwelling therein are emotional entities: creatures like untamed animals, which are never happier than when running free. To them it\u2019s Joy; to the executive function in the psyche, it\u2019s Self-indulgence. Usurpation has taken place.",

Giving way to such feeling opens successively larger attacks by these same feelings. Fear, restlessness, desire, pride, jealousy or anger are similar strong elements which quickly take over and cause movement which is no longer self-governed. Thus we lose our direction. If we look for any way to solve our problems other than to follow our path modestly and \u201cwithout purpose,\u201d we are certain to be put through distressing situations.

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Metamorphosis, Water and Fire extinguish each other. When two daughters with opposing viewpoints live together, change is inevitable; but after the change is accomplished, faith is accorded to it: Clarity brings good cheer and progress through what is correct. When a transformation is properly accomplished, all occasion for regret disappears. Heaven and earth undergo their changes, and the four seasons complete their functions. The rulers of old transformed the state in accordance with the will of heaven and in response to the wishes of men. Great indeed is what takes place in a time of change.",
        "Legge": "The written character translated as Metamorphosis is used here in the sense of changing. Originally used for the skin of an animal or bird, it received the significance of changing at a very early time. The figure deals with the subject of changes which are called for in the state of the country. The necessity for change is recognized, and hints are given as to the spirit and manner in which they should be brought about. \n The Judgment assumes that change is viewed by people generally with suspicion and dislike, and therefore should not be made hastily. [This can refer to inner complexes, habits, etc. \u2013 Ed.]  When the necessity for change has been proven beforehand and subsequently carried out with firm correctness, then the issue will turn out satisfactorily. \n The lower trigram is the symbol for Fire and the upper for Water. Water extinguishes fire, and fire dries up water. Each \"changes\" the other. The lower trigram is also the second daughter and the upper is the youngest daughter. In the scheme of the trigrams these two are seen to be mutually incompatible."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Hidden within its cocoon the caterpillar becomes a butterfly -- who would believe it until the Metamorphosis was complete? \n The Superior Man recognizes that celestial sequences create changes only when they are due; he therefore acts in accordance with the requirements of the times. \n The forty-ninth hexagram makes an analogy between the natural Metamorphosisof animal pelts and the proper way to regard radical changes in government. Lines one, five and six all refer to skin, and two, three and four refer to politics. The general idea is that radical transformations occur at their own natural pace -- they cannot be successfully forced any more than eggs can be made to hatch before their time. The Image makes this point in its reference to the celestial correlation of the seasons. \n\n\n There is a time for everything, \n A time for every occupation under heaven: \n A time for giving birth, \n A time for dying; \n A time for planting, \n A time for uprooting what has been planted (etc)... \n Ecclesiastes 3: 1-2 \n\n\n Once one assumes conscious responsibility for the Work, there comes a long and indefinite period in which one labors unceasingly without any visible results at all. Dream images and I Ching meditations will indicate that progress is being made, but the ego's life in spacetime consists of seemingly fruitless labor in the service of a transcendental ideal. This is a universal experience -- it happens to everyone who undertakes the Work. In the Western Mystery Tradition it is known as the Dark Night of the Soul. (See Hexagram Number-36 for further insights into this unavoidable phenomenon.) \n\n\n The Personality undergoes a willful \"death,\u201d surrendering everything that it believes itself to be. Most difficult is that this total surrender of life, this initiatory sacrifice, must precede the experience of cosmic awareness. One is required to give up the totality of one's being, one's very life, in relative darkness, yet in the faith that there will be a resurrection into the Light. \nR. Wang -- The Qabalistic Tarot\n\n\n Psychologically interpreted, Metamorphosis means that changes are taking place in the unconscious psyche, but don't expect them to manifest until their growth is complete. The ego must recognize this and persevere with the Work, even when \"common sense\" counsels otherwise. It is a period of probation and trial, and many there are who fail the test. \n\n\n There is no short cut without impeding growth or setting the flow pattern of the Soul back, until each physical or psychological function has been correctly connected or developed ... Many aspirants do not perceive this law and become impatient and even lose faith when Providence seems to be holding back. Nothing occurs outside its time as it is part of a sequence in the great cosmic cycle that unfolds the Grand Design of Existence. \nZ.B.S. Halevi -- Kabbalah and Exodus\n\n\n If there is any consolation in this terrible ordeal, it is that others have made the journey before you, and survived. Keep the faith that, in the imagery of this hexagram, the lower trigram of Clear Perception following the upper trigram of Cheerfulness will lead you through the most challenging of all transformations. \n\n\n Where the issue of ultimate meaning is constellated, transformation will eventually occur, even though only by way of a great deal of suffering. \nE. C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest",

You don't really know if it is an appropriate time to act. Wait until you're sure. A little moderation will do a world of good now, whereas premature action will bring difficulties. \n Editor:  There is a proofreading error in the Confucian commentary on this line which is preserved in both the Dover and Mentor editions of Legge's translation. The comment should read: \"He should ... not be taking action.\" The idea of the hexagram is molting, but at the beginning one is still wrapped in the protective skin of one's chrysalis. Try to remove a butterfly from its cocoon and you will surely kill it. The growth cycle must complete itself fully before the revolution can take place or the new order prevail. Sometimes the line can suggest the idea of being hidebound -- stuck in a mental cocoon of limiting beliefs. (Yellow is the color of clarity, intellect.) Hidebound: \"Having an inflexible or ultraconservative character: bigoted, narrow.\" As always, the exact interpretation depends upon your intuition about the situation at hand. \n\n\n No one except perhaps the wisest can perceive what lies within him, what is present at that point in a negative form, ready to manifest tomorrow or a million years from now. \nZ.B.S.

        "Notes": "Siu:  After a series of unsuccessful attempts, the man's chance to make effective changes has come. He succeeds because of the requisite capabilities, thorough planning, and public confidence. \n Wing: You have reached a point where change is both necessary and timely. To bring this about requires a strong vision of the ultimate outcome and a thorough commitment to your project, but with the correct inner attitude, you will meet with success. You will now find additional support in others. \n Editor:  This line is conditional and subject to misunderstanding if taken as an injunction for immediate action.Legge\u2019s commentary and the Siu and Wing paraphrases misinterpret the timing covertly explicit here: the core idea is to prepare yourself now for a later change, not to take action now. This echoes the promise in Wilhelm's Judgment: \"On your own day you are believed.\"  Blofeld adds a prescient footnote to his translation: \"We must not advance further until certain major changes have been completed.\u201d Because the Work demands almost superhuman levels of restraint, one often receives this line as a kind of promise: \" When the Work is completed you may begin to be active again in the world.\" \n\n\n Kabbalah is an undramatic tradition that requires great patience and stability. One of the reasons for this tempo is that everyone has to mature his potential gradually and thoroughly at his natural pace. In this way his life's work unfolds at the right moment in his own and the cosmos's time. \nZ.B.S. Halevi -- Kabbalah \n\n A. Prepare the groundwork for the changes you anticipate. Change will come when you're ready for it."

Blofeld: What else could we do under the circumstances? Ritsema/Karcher: Furthermore actually wherefore having-them. Cleary (2): Make three presentations. Where are you going? Wu: What else can be done? \n Legge:  The symbolism of line three is twofold. The line is dynamic and in his correct position, but has passed the center of the lower trigram of Clarity and is on an outward verge. These conditions may dispose him to reckless and violent changes which would be bad. But if he acts with caution and due deliberation he may take action, and he will be believed in. \n Anthony:  Changes are difficult to make. If we expect too much progress too soon, we are being hasty; if we do not put forth energy to persevere because the task seems too difficult, this is being excessively conservative. We need strength to make changes; strength comes only from seeing clearly that we must make this effort.",

He will succeed. \n Wing: Do not step into change hastily, for this will bring misfortune. Yet if you hesitate or deny the possibility of change you will put yourself in danger. Rely upon openness and self-control to guide you. When the necessity of Changing has made itself perfectly clear, and when you have thoroughly contemplated its effect, you may then proceed. \n Editor: This depicts a situation in which one must find the proper balance between action and inaction. The line is an unambiguous warning about being clear in one's mind and cautious in one's transactions. Balanced differentiations (perhaps augmented by mature advice from others) are called for. A rather callow impatience is implied, so it is useful to note the third place in Hexagram 17 (Following) which is created if this is the only changing line: \u201cBy staying with the strong man, you lose the boy. Through following, one will gain what one seeks. To continue benefits\u201d (Liu). This is an unambiguous picture of immaturity (inexperience) rectified via seasoned discernment \u2013 psychologically, an image of the ego \u201cfollowing\u201d the intentions of the Self. \n\n\n Perfect sincerity leads to activity. Activity leads to change. And change leads to transformation. Hence it is said, \"One will consider before he speaks and deliberate before he acts. By such consideration and deliberations he undertakes to complete all changes and transformations.\" \nChou Tun-I \n\n A.

To \"change the existing ordinances\" is to change your beliefs or attitudes. Ritsema/Karcher define \"possessing conformity\" as: \"inner and outer are in accord; confidence of the spirits has been captured.\" They translate \"amend\" (i.e. \"amending fate\") as \"fighting your own errors.\" This reflects Anthony\u2019s observation: \u201cCapricious demands from our inferiors\u2026will have a bad effect.\u201d (In Anthony\u2019s paradigm, \u201cour inferiors\u201d relate to our habits, complexes, etc.) If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number 63, Completion, suggesting that a major synthesis may be at hand if you\u2019re careful. \n\n\n Such a solution will not appear in the form of an intellectual conclusion or thought-out plan, but will arise in dream or phantasy in the form of an image or symbol, so unexpected and yet so apt that its appearance will seem like a miracle.

It has power to bring the opposing demands of the psyche together in a newly created form through which the life energies can flow in a new creative effort. \nM.E. Harding --Psychic Energy\n\n A.

It is through the letter of the law (the details) that inferior men are made to comply (to change their faces) and show obedience. This is a reiteration of the superior man's role in the Image: \"The Superior Man regulates the calendar and thus ensures that men are clear about times and seasons\" (Blofeld). \n Psychologically interpreted, the tiger can be seen as the Self, the leopard as the ego, and the small (inferior) men as the complexes -- the habits, appetites, drives and passions within the unconscious psyche. Cleary\u2019s Taoist commentary warns the ego to \u201cmaintain both the spirit and letter of the law\u201d lest your complexes rationalize the situation (many spots) and adulterate the Work. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number 13, Union of Forces, the corresponding line of which depicts an incomplete synthesis. Ritsema/Karcher\u2019s Confucian commentary for 13:6 sums it up succinctly: \u201cPurpose not-yet acquired indeed.\u201d This strongly implies that the \u201cinferior men\u201d in the current line (whatever they symbolize in the situation at hand) represent cause for concern: Will the Metamorphosis be successful or not? Ritsema/Karcher\u2019s: \u201cRighteous persistence brings good fortune to those who remain where they are\u201d portrays the best strategy for dealing with this situation. Anthony\u2019s commentary nicely supplements this in contemporary idiom. \n\n\n Our objective is to abstract patterns from Nature (right hemisphere thinking), but many proposed patterns do not in fact correspond to the data. Thus all proposed patterns must be subjected to the sieve of critical analysis (left hemisphere thinking). The search for patterns without critical analysis, and rigid skepticism without a search for patterns, are the antipodes of incomplete science. The effective pursuit of knowledge requires both functions. \nCarl Sagan -- The Dragons of Eden\n\n A. The image suggests the refinement of details in a transformation. As the ego consolidates its new position, archetypal forces (complexes, habitual responses, limiting beliefs) are forced to conform to the altered psychic hierarchy. Stand pat and hold fast to prevent backsliding. \n B. Do nothing until you've analyzed all aspects of the situation at hand. Beware of inferior forces influencing your choices. \n\n June 16, 2001, 4/25/06"

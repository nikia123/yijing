    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "His feeling of dread leads to happiness because he is thereby made to adopt proper laws for himself. The movement startles the distant and frightens the near, yet he makes the proper sacrifices the same as always.",
        "Legge": "Shock consists of the trigram for Thunder doubled. (This trigram also represents Movement and the Eldest Son.) The hexagram therefore symbolizes a crash or peal of thunder, and combined with the idea of movement shows a sudden change taking place in the kingdom. The lesson is the conduct to be pursued in a time of sudden change through an awareness of danger and the proper regulation of oneself. \n A successful issue is predicted if the dynamic first line can be superior to the two magnetic lines above him. It is in the idea of the hexagram that he should be moving and advancing. Although sensible of the danger, he is confident and self-possessed -- so much so that he can calmly perform his religious duties during the prevailing chaos. This is proper behavior for the eldest son, who must eventually assume the duties of his father. \n Anthony: In the I Chingshock means being subjected to unsettling events. It also means perceiving and reacting to these events \u2026 perceiving, in any of these changes, that a new set of limits, or deprivations, has been placed on our life which seems to restrict or even penalize us. This sense of being projected by events into a sort of emotional trap is what this hexagram calls \u201cFate.\u201d Acknowledgement of this fate, or trap, and the imperative \u2013 to find the way out \u2013 is one of the purposes of shock. As far as the I Ching is concerned, there is only one way out \u2013 to undergo spiritual development."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  During sudden changes, adjust your tempo and move ahead, remembering that while conditions may alter, the goal remains the same. \n The Superior Man  double-checks his premises, confronts his weak spots and adheres to the rules and ideals of the Work. \n The image here is one of a sudden, dramatic release of energy, power and force. To receive this hexagram without changing lines can refer to almost any abrupt, startling or unexpected situation. Sometimes it is the oracle's way of saying: \"Surprise!\u201d It can also be a kind of reprimand for asking a dumb or inappropriate question -- the oracle is \"shocked\u201d by your temerity, ignorance, etc. In such instances there is often an element of wry humor in the situation -- usually at the ego's expense. On rare occasions, it is possible to receive this hexagram as a warning about an upcoming event which has no bearing on the question posed. Should you receive such an oracle, be extremely vigilant \u2013 as always, the advice to the superior man in the Image suggests the proper course. \n A true test of devotion to the Work is to maintain one's will under all circumstances. The world may be falling apart around us, but the adept does not ruin the performance of his sacrifice: the ego continues the Work regardless of conditions, and keeps a cool head under all circumstances. \n\n\n Have no fear of sudden terror \n or of assault from wicked men, \n since Yahweh will be your guarantor, \n He will keep your steps from the snare. \n Proverbs 3: 25-26 \n\n\n Both Yahweh and Christ are what Jung calls \"god images\u201d which exist in one form or another in every human psyche, whether it is consciously religious or not. The god image is synonymous with the Self, and the implication of the above quotation from Proverbsis that as long as the ego remains devoted to the Work -- in I Chingterms: \"maintains the sacrifice\u201d -- it is under the protection of the Self. \n\n\n The Perfect Man is godlike. Though the great swamps blaze, they cannot burn him; though the great rivers freeze, they cannot chill him; though swift lightning splits the hills and howling gales shake the sea, they cannot frighten him. A man like this rides the clouds and mist, straddles the sun and moon, and wanders beyond the four seas. Even life and death have no effect on him, much less the rules of profit and loss! \nChuang Tzu",

        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge:  A magnetic line is mounted on a dynamic one. Wilhelm/Baynes: It rests upon a firm line. Blofeld: That the approach of thunder presages trouble is indicated by the position of this yielding line over a firm one. Ritsema/Karcher: Riding a solid indeed.

[The weak second six \u201crides\u201d on the strong first nine and finds what a perilous situation he is in.] \n Legge:  The peril in line two is suggested by her position immediately above line one. The rest of the symbolism is obscure, and Chu Hsi says he does not understand it. The subject of the line does what she can to get out of danger, and finally, as is signified by the central position of the line, the issue is better than could have been expected.

        "Notes": "Siu:  An uprising endangers the man. He accepts the material losses and ascends to lofty heights inaccessible to the threatening forces. After the shock and upheaval have subsided, his property will be restored without his fighting for it. \n Wing:  A cataclysmic upheaval can cause you great losses. Do not try to resist or fight the forces, since this is impossible. Instead, remove yourself from the dangerous situation. Become inaccessible. In time you will recoup your losses. \n Editor:  Symbolically, the symbolism is not obscure at all: the basic idea is to transcend your habitual responses and view them from a higher perspective. When things have settled down again, losses will prove to be illusory. \n\n\n Verily destruction is the foundation of existence, \n And the tearing down thou seest \n Is but the assembling of material \n for a greater structure... \n Deluded are they who say, \n \"Man liveth by the Mercy of the Lord.\" \n Know ye \n That the balance of Mercy and Severity \n Is the continuance of every life, \n Yea, and of this whole universe. \n P.F.

Wu: His position is improper. \n Legge:  Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place, but if she moves on to the fourth place, which would be correct for her, the issue will not be bad. \n Anthony: The shock of encountering our fate, which seems unbearably harsh, causes emotional trauma. It is as if we are suddenly and irrevocably put into a bad predicament with no options. This negativism, however, means we are still under the effects of shock.

Try, at all costs, to maintain your composure. Look for an avenue of change that will alleviate the danger. \n Editor:  Wilhelm comments: \"The word su, here rendered by \u2018distraught,\u2019 denotes literally the reviving movements of insects still stiff after their winter sleep.\u201d Ritsema/Karcher translate SU as: \"Regain vital energy, courage or strength; bring to life, cheer up; relief; lit.: herb whose smell revives weary spirits. The doubled character intensifies this quality.\u201d The image is one of groggy confusion during a time demanding decisive action: \"Wake up and smell the coffee!\u201d Wilhelm also mentions that the line has reference to a foreordained or fated situation -- the shock of fate. The idea is that your fate is demanding that you get moving, that you wake up from your torpor and take action in accordance with the goals of the Work. \n\n\n The marvel is that there is not a perpetual state of war within the psyche, for each of these elements is endowed with energy and so cannot die. Fortunately for our sanity, many of these irreconcilable elements lie deep within the unconscious, locked in primordial sleep; those which may have stirred are shut away in separate compartments. But as life progresses and an increase of consciousness is achieved, the inner conflicts awaken, and the problem of reconciling the oppositions they reveal has to be undertaken as a serious and urgent task. \nM.E.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet shining indeed. Cleary (2):Thunder getting bogged down is not illuminating. Wu: He cannot bring himself to a bright spot. \n Legge: The fourth line is dynamic in a magnetic place, and is pressed by the magnetic lines on either side, hence he is seen as supinely sinking in the mud.

        "Notes": "Siu: The man is unable to make progress against an unyielding situation and remains trapped by its stubborn resistance. \n Wing: The Shocking event will reduce you to immobility. This comes about because of a befuddled mind, confused and unprepared. You cannot make any progress under the circumstances. \n Editor: The image is of one who is trapped in obtuseness and ambiguity, as in mud. Muddy: Unclear, as in: \"This is as clear as mud.\u201d Note that no value judgment is attached to the line. Meditation on the similarities between this line and 21:4 is useful. \n\n\n But as the mind matures its principles tend to harden and gradually become fixed, and it becomes unable to accept fresh material which will not fit easily into the existing structure. Thus it loses contact with the dynamism of reality. Its enclosing walls of dogmatic opinion become unable to adapt to changing circumstances, and if faced with a major challenge of ideas it can only collapse, leaving the bewildered mind within to cope as best it may with the apparent chaos that surrounds it. The lesson here is that any structure is only defensible as long as it remains flexible and capable of evolution; life itself is in a state of constant flux and no merely human construction can hope to survive if it cannot adapt. \nA.

Retreat is the best course, although it may bring criticism from others who do not comprehend your actions. \n Anthony:  We must not let shocking events cause us to vilify the Sage, Fate, God, or the people who have wronged us. Shock brings an end to the old, but also a beginning to the new, even though we encounter many dangers to get there.

Line six is advised to learn from her observation of line five's troubles to remain calm and stationary, out of the fray. In other words, by analyzing the adversity of others, one can avoid making their mistakes. Another way of conveying the same idea is to regard the \"relative\u201d who might \"speak against\u201d line six as the third line correlate who is forced by her circumstances to take action: because of this, line three is unable to understand why line six cannot support her. The clear message here is one of adopting an unconventional or independent point of view: survival now depends on not following the crowd. Blofeld, Liu, Ritsema/Karcher and Wu are the only translators who mention \"gossip about marriage.\" Psychologically interpreted, this can mean stress connected with any synthesis of thought and feeling -- perhaps a new attitude or belief. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes number twenty-one, Discernment, giving a hint that cold-blooded, dispassionate analysis is the best way to cope with a tricky situation. \n\n\n The devastating impact of this fire can free the mind from its fetters and open the way that leads to the center; but if the conscious mind is not prepared, not strongly built on firm foundations, it may end in catastrophe.

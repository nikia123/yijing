    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "The magnetic line ascends as opportunity permits. We have Flexibility, Obedience and a dynamic line below with his magnetic correlate above: this means successful progress. See the great man -- his will is accomplished in the south.",
        "Legge": "The character for this hexagram means advancing in an upward direction, or ascending. The figure symbolizes the promotion of an able officer to the highest pinnacle of distinction. The action of the dynamic second line is tempered by being in the magnetic central position of the lower trigram. As the representative of Pushing Upward he is forceful, yet modest and the magnetic fifth line ruler welcomes his advance. The officer therefore has the qualities that fit him to ascend as well as a favorable opportunity to do so. \n After he has met with the \"great man\" in line five, advance to the south will be fortunate. Chu Hsi says that this is equivalent to \"advancing forwards.\u201d Since the south is the region of brightness and warmth, the progress will be easy and agreeable. \n The lower trigram symbolizes Wood, and its weak first line is the root of a tree buried in the earth of the upper trigram. The gradual growth of this root pushes the trunk upward as the circumstances of time permit."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Ascend in accordance with the will of the Self. Turn toward clarity. \n The Superior Man grows a little every day. \n The image of the 46th hexagram is of a plant growing in the earth, gradually pushing upward toward the sun. That \"an advance to the south is fortunate\" means that as all plants turn southward toward the sun, their source of nourishment, so should we turn toward the light and clarity of the \"great man\" or Self within us. \n The upward advancement of the Work is an organic process. There is no such thing as \"instant enlightenment.\" The many stories and parables of instant Satori which are common in the Zen Buddhist tradition are actually just dramatic accounts of the final few moments' resolution that come after a lifetime of slow and patient devotion. The Work progresses at the pace of a tree -- what started out as an acorn eventually becomes a forest giant, but it doesn't happen overnight. \n\n\n Remember ever that Mind in its entirety is ever the Builder. For it is step by step, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, there a little, that the attaining is accomplished in the mental, the spiritual, the material applications of an entity in this material world. \nEdgar Cayce \u2013 Book of Changes\n\n\n\n This slow growth is an accumulation of countless \"gathering togethers\" as depicted in the preceding hexagram, of whichPushing Upward is the upside-down image. It is estimated that an adult human being grows from a single cell to about one-hundred billion cells through a process of fifty-billion mitotic divisions. It is interesting to observe that \"one-hundred-billion\" is the scientific estimate of the number of stars in any given galaxy. If we apply the Hermetic Axiom: \"As above, so below\" to this relationship of macrocosm to microcosm we get the image of our solar system as a single atom in the \"body\" of a galactic entity. \n That should put the Work into perspective! \n\n\n Understand that thou art a second little world and that the sun and the moon are within thee, and also the stars. \nOrigen --Homiliae in Leviticum",

On the other hand, the objective psyche appears to insist on a continuous dynamic relationship between itself and its focal point in the ego. The conscious ego must make the effort to relate to the unconscious, its maternal source-ground, in order to maintain adequate, healthy functioning. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest\n\n A.

Wu: The sincerity of the second nine brings about joy. \n Legge:  Compare this with the second line of hexagram number 45. Line two is dynamic, and the magnetic fifth line is his proper correlate. This suggests a dynamic officer serving a magnetic ruler. He couldn't do so unless he was possessed by a sincere and devoted loyalty. In his loyal devotion to line five he will do much good and benefit many, hence we have the words: \"affords occasion for joy.\"",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man is an effective but brusque officer serving a weak leader. His upright sincerity and devoted loyalty meet with a favorable response. \n Wing:  You can achieve your aim even though you have only modest resources. Those in authority will be moved by your sincerity despite your lack of traditional criteria. \n Editor: Whenever sacrifice is mentioned in the I Ching, it is wise to meditate on the deeper meaning of the concept to see how it applies to the matter under question. The situation depicted here shows a dynamic correlate (the \"representative ofPushing Upward\" mentioned in Legge's commentary on the hexagram), serving a magnetic ruler. To be dynamic in a magnetic place suggests one who may be predisposed to impatience. The sacrifice could be an attitude or belief influencing one to this. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number 15, Temperance, so the sacrifice could also involve pride. \n\n\n On the psychological level, transformation and sacrifice imply a giving up of some aspect of \"I am,\" \"I have\" or \u201cI can,\" claims and habits, a renouncing of some cherished needs, convictions or illusions. It may call for a relativization of one's superior psychological function in favor or the less developed \"inferior\u201d function. A thinking type may have to renounce exclusive reliance upon the intellect in favor of feeling and emotion. A feeling type may have to learn to subordinate or at least coordinate emotional responses with thought and reason. An overly active, driving and controlling person may have to learn a degree of receptivity, yielding and surrender which, to her or him, may feel like passivity; a passive person may have to become more actively responsible for his or her own life or therapeutic management. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing \n\n A. The ego's sacrifices (your pretensions to knowledge? Your impulse to take action?) are necessary for the furtherance of the Work. \n B. A humble offering -- every little bit helps."

A little caution is a good thing now if you do not allow it to halt your progress completely. \n Editor: Whenever one receives an oracle without the value judgment of \"good fortune\" or \"there will be evil,\" it is wise to be especially heedful. This line describes easy progress -- which may or may not be a good thing, depending on the situation. Sometimes it can refer to making an assumption -- without, however, a clue as to whether the assumption is accurate! The line can also alert one to something new or unknown: the fact that no value judgment is appended suggests that a test may be involved. \n\n\n Many times when I was concentrating on my work and thinking about nothing else, I suddenly recognized a truth which had no relationship whatever with my work...At such moments I felt as if my head had just poked up through the ceiling of one room and emerged above the floor in an upper room.

Continue in your principles and hold to sound traditions. \n Editor:  This line doesn't lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. Symbolically, mountains represent a high level of awareness within the psyche. To be employed by the king to present offerings on a holy mountain suggests actions which are extremely valuable to the Work, even if you may not understand what is taking place. (Compare with line 17:6.) Wu\u2019s conditional phrasing here is in accord with a somewhat specialist historical political interpretation which may not apply in most modern contexts. \n\n\n Mountains are symbols of the abode of the gods. Consider Sinai, Olympus, Meru, Fujiyama. Again, they suggest climbing, aspiration, the possibility of attainment. We all have peaks to climb, and the incentive to action, the disposing element in our consciousness which leads to volition, has always in the background this idea of climbing above our present level. Thus the mountain represents what alchemists call the Great Work.\nP.F. Case -- The Tarot \n\nA. A major insight. \n B. Ego and Self are in accord. Progress is in harmony with the goals of the Work."

Perhaps a dialectical process within the psyche is nearing synthesis. The line can sometimes imply that there is a need to slow down, or that a more dignified and orderly approach to the Work is in order. \n\n\n We are all, at times at least, inclined to feel that the reality of our lives falls short of our intuitive picture of some kind of completeness. But thereby we lose sight of the fact that the image of wholeness is itself meant to be a symbolic one, seemingly never literally or finally to be reached -- a pole star that sets a direction for the traveler rather than a goal to be reached concretely. The way to reach closer to completeness then appears to lie in taking each step as it comes in terms of precisely what it is and at the same time as if related to an encompassing pattern. \nE.C.

Cleary\u2019s version of the Confucian commentary reads: \u201cRising into the unknown on high dissolves poverty.\u201d This seems to be the exact opposite of all the other translations. (Wilhelm\u2019s rendering is the most succinct:\u201cAt the top is decrease and not wealth.\u201d) Cleary\u2019s rendition is based on Chi-hsu Ou-I\u2019s Buddhist commentary, which states: \u201cWhen one rises into the unknown, then one can stop; but if one is unceasingly correct, then one should rise yet further into the unknown. This is what is called spiritual rank. If they cultivate spiritual rank, people of low social status are not really poor and lowly \u2013 their poverty can disappear.\u201d Since Chi-hsu Ou-i was not a translator, but reading and writing in his own language, one wonders how such a seemingly anomalous interpretation of Confucius could occur. Nevertheless, from the Buddhist perspective the concepts of poverty and wealth are reversed: \u201cpoverty\u201d is wealth, \u201cwealth\u201d is poverty in terms of spiritual value at the top of the hexagram of Ascending. \n\n\n I go the way that Providence dictates with the assurance of a sleepwalker. \nAdolph Hitler \n When you got nothin,\u2019 you got nothin\u2019 to lose. \nBob Dylan \n\n A.

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Innocence shows the dynamic first line descending from the upper trigram to become the lord of the hexagram in the lower trigram. We see the attributes of Motive Power and Strength. The dynamic fifth line is central and responded to by the magnetic second line. It is the will of heaven that true progress can only proceed from correctness. If the action of the subject is incorrect he will fall into error, and it will be unfortunate for him to move in any direction. Where can one with the illusion of innocence proceed? Can anything be accomplished by someone without the assistance of heaven's will?",
        "Legge": "Of the two Chinese characters which symbolize Innocence, one is the symbol of being reckless, and often of being insincere; these two characters in combination describe a state of entire freedom from such a condition. The subject of the hexagram therefore, is one who is simple and sincere. This quality is characteristic of heaven, and of the highest style of humanity. The figure is an essay on this noble attribute. But an absolute rectitude is essential to it. The nearer one comes to the ideal of the quality, the more powerful will be his influence and the greater his success. But let him see to it that he never swerve from being correct. \n Anthony: Innocence means to let go of the present, thereby letting the future become what it will and being at peace with it\u2026 When we have learned to do a thing for its own sake, we know the meaning of innocence\u2026 In keeping our minds open and free, we are able to meet unexpected events with the help of the Creative, which always points out the correct and most appropriate response."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Success is possible only if you are impeccably correct. If such is not the case, take no action at all. (\"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.\") \n The Superior Man acts in harmony with the times. \n The ancient kings in the Image are mentioned by name in seven hexagrams. (See the commentary on hexagram number 20, Contemplation, for a fuller discussion of their symbolism.) Here, the Image shows them synchronizing their laws with the \"laws of nature\" -- an archetypal concept which is found in many mystical traditions. Here is the alchemical version: \n\n\n The individual terrestrial life should correspond to the laws governing the universe; man's spiritual aspirations should be directed to harmonize with the wisdom of God. If we accomplish this, the inner consciousness will awaken to an understanding of the influences of the stars, and the mysteries of Nature will be revealed to his spiritual perception. \nParacelsus \n\n\n In terms of the hexagram of Innocence, the idea is that if you are truly synchronized with your inner cosmos, if you are truly \"innocent\" (i.e., perfect), you may succeed under the prevailing conditions, but if you are not in complete inner accord you would be well advised to sit tight and take no action. To paraphrase the last sentence of the Confucian commentary: \"Can the ego do anything advantageously without the concurrence of the Self?\" \n\n\n \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d\nMatthew 5: 48 \n\n\n To use the Christian injunction in illustration: the upper trigram of Heaven is perfect, and the lower trigram of Movement is asked to reflect on how far he conforms to this ideal. In psychological terms, how do the goals of the ego compare with those of the Self, the entity to whom the Work is dedicated? \n Wilhelm has some interesting commentary on this hexagram, stating that it can indicate unexpected misfortune. In his book,Lectures on the I Ching, he comments: \n\n\n Wu Wang is very peculiar, and its name is not easy to translate. I have used \"Innocence,\" or the \u201cUnintentional.\" Having meanwhile thought about the matter more, I would today render Wu Wang with the term \u201cSubconscious,\" even though this expression seems somewhat too modern ... That which as [Divorcement] severs life enters here into unconscious realms ... Because the shock is within and is unconscious, it cannot take its course, and therefore causes the unexpected to happen. An unexpected disaster is afoot; something may be robbed or stolen. \n\n\n See line three and its commentaries for further insights into Wilhelm's ideas here. \n To receive this hexagram without changing lines is tantamount to being asked if you are perfect enough to take action without harm. Sometimes, depending on circumstances, it can also suggest that your position is correct and blameless. As always, the context of your query will leave no doubt when this latter interpretation is intended. If there is doubt, rephrase the question and ask until you understand. The oracle uses ambiguity to develop your intuition -- especially so on those occasions when all you want is a quick answer. \n\u00a0\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION \n Compare what is said here about the Ancient Kings with what is said about them in hexagrams 8, 16, 20, 21, 24, and 59. What common theme unites them, and how does it relate to the concept of the Work?",

[This means aspiring only to attain enlightenment, not thinking of riches or rank. Then it is beneficial to go somewhere.] Wu: For he is not after material rewards. \n Legge:  Line two is magnetic, central, and in her correct place. She is entirely free from selfish or mercenary motives. She is good for the sake of goodness, and things are such that her action will be successful.

        "Notes": "Siu:  The man succeeds in everything he undertakes. He does not proceed with mercenary or selfish interests in mind but does good things for their own sake. Unsought wealth will come his way. \n Wing:  Do not dream about the results of your work or the attainment of your goal. Instead, take action for its own sake and devote your full attention to what you are now doing. Only in this way can you achieve your aim. \n Anthony: Innocence means to answer the duty required by the moment, regardless of consequences, looking neither forward nor backward. If we have hopes and expectations, we are disappointed when things do not work out on our imagined schedule. \n Editor:  The idea here is that the times are favorable to undertake something only if you are free of ulterior motives. Because Wilhelm's translation of this line is conditional, there is a suggestion that there may be some temptation toward selfishness within the situation. Keep an open mind and remain receptive to your experience. \n\n\n Think of the flowers; they never have to spin or weave; yet, I assure you, not even Solomon in all his regalia was robed like one of these...

Blofeld: The former gains an ox at the cost of the owner's suffering. [The calamity may be threatening us. Otherwise, the implication is that we cannot avoid gaining something at severe cost to others.]Ritsema/ Karcher: Capital people, calamity indeed. Cleary (2): When a traveler finds the cow, it is a misfortune for the local people. Wu: The passerby gets the ox and the villager faces a loss. \n Legge:  Sometimes calamity may befall the best of us, even when there is freedom from insincerity. Line three, being magnetic in a dynamic place, is vulnerable to this misfortune. The people of the neighborhood are of course entirely innocent. On line three it is said: \"The superior man seeks simply to be free from insincerity, and leaves the question of happiness and calamity to Heaven.\u201d",
        "Notes": "Siu:  Undeserved calamity comes to the sincere person. Unexpected misfortunes of this kind, however, do not throw the superior man off stride. \n Wing:  Undeserved and unexpected misfortune may come your way. It will pass. An attitude of Innocence does not preclude bad luck, as such shifts of fortune are unavoidable. However, an innocent posture should not be abandoned for it can reveal new ways of dealing with problems. \n Anthony: Situations occur which are negative, and it is not our fault. Nevertheless, we must adjust to them with acceptance. To fail to do so will only bring on further misfortune. We should not let negative events destroy our innocence of mind. \n Editor: The symbolism usually implies that you have just been wronged through no fault of your own. Cleary\u2019s Buddhist commentary introduces a different interpretation: \u201cThis represents the unbalanced and aberrant who cling to a principle that is without error and make it into a misfortune. When a traveler finds the cow, why then cling to principle and seek a reward from the local people? Is this not misfortune extending to the innocent?\u201d Note that the references to the innocent villagers\u2019 culpability in Legge, Liu and Cleary-2 suggest there may be hidden nuances to this line. \n\n\n Yes, injustice committed by another is an injustice for the one who has committed it and he is not released from his responsibility. But, considered within the universal order, it is not an injustice in the cosmos, not even for the one who has suffered it. It is a necessary occurrence. If the one who undergoes it is a good man, it will have for him a happy issue. One must not believe this cosmic order to be \"not of the gods\" or unjust. It distributes exactly to each what is fitting to each. But we are ignorant of the causes and that accords our ignorance the occasion for blaming it. \nPlotinus --The Enneads \n\nA. \"Into each life some rain must fall.\" \nB.

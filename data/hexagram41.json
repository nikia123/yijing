    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Compensating Sacrificethe lower trigram is diminished to increase the upper, and the flow is upward. The two baskets of grain accord with the time. There is a time when the strong should be diminished and the weak strengthened. Decrease and increase, overflowing and emptiness, take place in harmony with the demands of the time.",
        "Legge": "Ch'eng-tzu says: \"Every diminution and repression of what we have in excess to bring it into accordance with right and reason is comprehended under Compensating Sacrifice. If there is sincerity in doing this it will lead to success and happiness, and even if the offering is small, yet it will be accepted.\" \n The K'ang-hsi editors say: \"What is meant by diminishing in this hexagram is the regulation of expenditure or contribution according to the time. This would vary in a family according to its poverty or wealth, and in a state according to the abundance or scantiness of its resources. If one supplements the insufficiency of his offering with the abundance of his sincerity, the insignificance of his two baskets will not be despised.\" \n The waters of a marsh are continually rising up in vapor to bedew the hill above it, and thus increase its verdure. What is taken from the marsh gives increase to the hill."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  A sacrifice creates equilibrium. \n The Superior Man  sacrifices his appetites to a higher principle. \n The traditional name for this hexagram is Decrease, but the lines and commentary all describe a compensating exchange of forces to attain equilibrium. The idea of \"sacrifice\" is mentioned in the Judgment, and that also might make a good title, though the image of two baskets of grain suggests a balancing scale: a \"compensating\" device. In this hexagram, the flow of energy moves from below upwards -- the waters of the lake or marsh are dispersed to enrich the mountain. In psychological terms we think of the ego sacrificing or decreasing its autonomy to achieve psychic equilibrium with the Self: we forfeit something valuable to obtain something even more valuable. Without this quid pro quo, the concept of sacrifice is meaningless and irrational. \n\n\n A sacrifice is meant to be a loss, so that one may be sure that the egoistic claim no longer exists. Therefore the gift should be given as if it were being destroyed. But since the gift represents myself, I have in that case destroyed myself, given myself away without expectation of return. Yet, looked at in another way, this intentional loss is also a gain, for if you can give yourself it proves that you possess yourself. Nobody can give what he has not got.\n Jung -- Transformation Symbolism in the Mass\n\n\n Compare the Image message from hexagram number 15, Temperance with the notion of a compensating balance: \"The superior man, in accordance with this, diminishes his excesses to augment his insufficiencies, thus creating a just balance.\" We are reminded of another \"Temperance\" -- the 14th Arcanum of the Tarot, which depicts an angel pouring water from one vessel into another: \"compensating.\" A comparison of its symbolism with that of hexagram number 41 yields many insights: \n\n\n The Path of ... TEMPERANCE, leads from ... the Personality [ego] to the Higher Self ... The whole experience is one of preparation of the Personality [ego], and the body in which it is operating, to deal with an influx of Light which would be devastating to a system unready to handle such energy. Most important here is the monitoring of progress, the continual testing from above. It is the angel here which is at once the Higher Self and the initiatory forces of Nature, which pours the elixir from vase to vase. This is an ongoing process of testing; measuring to see how much the physical vehicle can bear. \nR. Wang --The Qabalistic Tarot\n\n\n Without belaboring the point, we can see that all sacrifice is a kind of remuneration: it couldn't be otherwise in an interconnected universe. The Image instruction for the superior man to \u201ccontrol his anger\u201d is also echoed in the Temperance card. This relates to: \n\n\n ...an aspect of the Mysteries only rarely discussed, and certainly germane to the Twenty-Fifth Path  [the Kabbalistic equivalent of the relationship between lines one and four in this hexagram]: this is the very real hostility often felt by the student toward the Path itself, as he works day after day and seems to be getting nowhere. Such hostility and frustration is in itself a major test; it is part and parcel of the work prior to the emergence of inner proofs. -- Ibid\n\n\n\"Decrease with sincerity\" (Liu) refers to one's continuous sacrifice for the goals of the Work, and \"curbing anger\" (Ritsema/Karcher) is how one handles the archetypal forces evoked when the decrease seems endless and you've yet to receive anything in return. Like any other hexagram, Compensating Sacrifice can symbolize an infinity of possible situations, but psychologically speaking we can first regard it as an image of sacrifice for the purpose of attaining a balance of power within the psyche. Without the sacrificial devotion of the ego, the Self cannot attain its will; and if the Self can't make it, the ego is doomed by default.",

To give or take too much can result in an imbalanced situation.

It says: \"Render all due assistance.\" It is left up to you to differentiate the appropriate amount, which is a hint that a test may be involved. (\"...Let him consider how far he should contribute of what is his for the other\" can sometimes imply a warning about slavish service to archetypal powers.) When compared with the image of line four, we get a definite picture of an active balancing of forces \u2013 perhaps a dialectical process. The Self is demanding a differentiation from the rational ego. This is a complex line which often implies messages which are literally impossible to put into words. \n\n\n Principally he must know how far he is willing to go, what he is willing to sacrifice.

Taken in this sense, the line can symbolize the Self (line four, upper trigram of Heaven) gaining from the ego's sacrifice in spacetime (line one, lower trigram of Earth).

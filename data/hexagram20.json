        "Confucius/Legge": "Observation from above -- from the trigram of Flexibility surmounting the trigram of Docility. The ruler is in his correct central position, and thus exhibits his lessons to all below. He has purified himself, but not yet sacrificed. All beneath look to him and are transformed. When we contemplate the spirit-like way of heaven, we see how the four seasons proceed without error. The sages, in accordance with this spirit-like way, laid down their instructions, and all under heaven yield submission to them.",
        "Legge": "The Chinese character from which this hexagram is named is used in the sense of both seeing and being seen. The theme is the sovereign and his people -- how he shows himself to them, and how they in turn perceive him. The two dynamic lines at the top belong to the ruler, and the four magnetic lines below represent his subjects. In the Judgment the ruler is portrayed as a worshipper at the commencement of a sacrifice. He is the great Manifester in line five. \n The lower trigram symbolizes earth, with the attribute of Docility; the upper trigram symbolizes wind, with the attributes of Flexibility and Penetration. Wind moving above the earth has the widest sweep, and nothing escapes its influence. The personal influence of the ruler effects much, but the ancient kings wished to add to that the power of published instructions which were specially adapted to the character and circumstances of the people. \n The spirit-like way of heaven is the invisible order underlying the laws of nature. [Ed. Note: Ritsema/Karcher use the phrase: \"Viewing Heaven's spirit tao... The all-wise person uses spirit tao to set-up teaching.\" Spirit(s), SHEN: independent spiritual powers that confer intensity on heart and mind by acting on the soul, KUEI; gods, daimons. Tao: way or path; ongoing process of being and the course it traces for each specific person or thing; keyword. The ideogram: go and head, leading and the path it creates.]"

    "Notes": "Judgment:  Contemplate your motivations and discern the purity of your intent. \"Put your money where your mouth is.\u201d or \"Walk your talk.\u201d\n The Superior Man evaluates and rectifies his attitudes. \n The \"ancient kings\u201d in the Image symbolize the creators of an original state of perfection -- an archetypal model toward which the superior man aspires. This idea is common to all mystical traditions, many of which depict this state in the image of an ideal or prototypical man. Here is a summary of the Gnostic conception: \n\n\n Not only the body but also the \"soul\" is a product of the cosmic powers, which shaped the body in the image of the divine Primal (or Archetypal) Man and animated it with their own psychical forces: these are the appetites and passions of natural man, each of which stems from and corresponds to one of the cosmic spheres [i.e., planets] and all of which together make up the astral soul of man, his \"psyche.\" \nH. Jonas -- The Gnostic Religion\n\n\n In the Kabbalah, the template of this archetypal man (named Adam Kadmon) exists in each of the four realms of consciousness corresponding to intuition, intellect, emotion and sensation, and \"he\" is perceived as androgynous in all of these worlds except the last -- the \"sensation\u201d world of our physical spacetime reality. \n\n\n The Adam of these first three worlds was androgynous. The Adam of the fourth world is the Adam of the expulsion, the Adam of flesh traversing the desert of his exile, and the Adam capable of reproducing himself now that he is no longer androgynous. \nC. Ponce -- Kabbalah \n\n\n Considering that androgyny is one of the symbols used in the Western Mystery Tradition to depict the correct union of male and female forces within the psyche, we quickly recognize that the properly matched male and female correlate lines in theI Ching are a Chinese depiction of the identical concept. Note that the messages of the following three quotations are in complete accord with the goal of the Work as outlined in theI Ching: \n\n\n Somewhere there is an Adam within each of us in need of restoration, in exile from the Garden. The aim of Kabbalism is the restoration of the divine man in the medium of mortal man. We are the laboratory and we are the workers who work in that space. \nC. Ponce --Kabbalah \n Within our six-foot body we must strive for the form which existed before the laying down of heaven and earth. \nThe Secret of the Golden Flower \n The destiny of man is to build the Heavenly Jerusalem on Earth. In other words, to civilize a planet. It is the aim of the occultist, in consort with all men of good will, to bring about this heavenly fact into earthly reality. And the only way it will come about is by every man doing the right thing at the right time for twenty-four hours a day. \nGareth Knight -- The Work of a Modern Occult Fraternity\n\n\n The ancient kings in hexagram number-20 base their laws upon their recognition of diversity among the various forces which make up the kingdom of the psyche. Their divine regulations therefore represent the proper ecology existing between heaven and earth, yin and yang, male and female, Logos and Eros. In this regard, theI Ching's version of the Archetypal Man might be seen as hexagram number-63, Completion, in which the polarity of each of the lines is in perfect correlation. (See the editor's commentary on Hexagram number 11 for further insights into this idea.) \n The theme of the hexagram is Contemplationof your situation to see if your attitude meets the archetypal standards of the Work. The worshipper in the Judgment has purified himself for sacrifice but has not yet carried it out. Wilhelm uses the word \"ablution\u201d in his translation of the Judgment. An ablution is a ritual cleansing associated with a religious rite: \n\n\n Ablution:  In alchemy ... the adept worker achieves [success] only by purifying his soul of all that commonly agitates it. Washing, then, symbolizes the purification not so much of objective and external evil as of subjective and inner evils ... The principle involved in this alchemic process is that implied in the maxim \"Deny thyself.\"\nJ. E. Cirlot --Dictionary of Symbols\n\n\n It is important to note that the sacrifice has yet to be performed: preparation is meaningless until it is acted upon. Psychologically, this refers to intellectual \"gnosis\" which still needs to be grounded in behavior. \n\n\n Wisdom is achieved very slowly. This is because intellectual knowledge, easily acquired, must be transformed into `emotional,' or subconscious, knowledge. Once transformed, the imprint is permanent. Behavioral practice is the necessary catalyst of this reaction. Without action, the concept will wither and fade. Theoretical knowledge without practical application is not enough ... Intellectually the answers have always been there, but this need to actualize by experience, to make the subconscious imprint permanent by `emotionalizing' and practicing the concept, is the key. \nBrian L. Weiss, MD -- Many Lives, Many Masters \n\n\n Without changing lines, Contemplation is an oracular invitation for you to consider your situation and especially your motivations in regard to it. One way of doing this is to reduce everything to a brief written statement, including your best conscious conclusions. Then ask for a comment from the oracle -- often it will become apparent that you have been undergoing a kind of examination. \n\u00a0\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION \n The ancient kings are mentioned in the Images of both this figure and number twenty-one, Discernment, immediately following. What are the differences between Contemplation and Discernment, as depicted in these images? How does the concept of sacrifice relate to this, as mentioned in the Judgment? Compare the Judgment of this hexagram with hexagrams and lines 17:6, 45:2, 46:2, 46:4, 47:2, 47:5 and 63:5 for further insights on this extremely important tenet of the Work.",

If you relate everything that comes your way in terms of your own life and attitudes, you cannot develop. \n Editor: As hopefully enlightened moderns we wince at what seems to be outrageous male chauvinism in some of the lines of theI Ching, but if we understand the symbolism psychologically a non-sexist message comes through. (Dream symbolism also often offends our conscious convictions.) Female figures usually represent our instinctive responses and the emotional-feeling aspects of our personality. Correct behavior demands that emotional responses be kept in their proper place at \"home\" within the psyche. This line implies that the situation demands a more dynamic approach. Note however, that there is no overt value judgment other than by implication; the puritanical Confucian commentary is not necessarily always applicable. The line sometimes just portrays a partial, incomplete view of the situation, saying in effect that \"there is more to the subject than meets the eye.\u201d \n\n\n If the doors to perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.

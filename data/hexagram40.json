    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Liberation shows the trigram of Movement above the trigram of Danger -- through movement there is an escape from peril. An early movement to the southwest wins the allegiance of the masses and returns the state to normalcy and equilibrium. When heaven and earth are freed from the grasp of winter, we have thunder and rain. When these come, the buds of the fruit-producing vegetation begin to open. Great indeed are the phenomena in the time ofLiberation.",
        "Legge": "The written Chinese character for Liberation is the symbol of unloosing -- untying a knot or unraveling a complication. This hexagram denotes a condition in which the obstruction and difficulty of the preceding figure have been removed. The lesson is how this new and better state of the kingdom should be dealt with. If no tasks remain to be completed, the sooner things resume their normal course the better. If further operations are necessary, let them be accomplished without delay. The K'ang-hsi editors say that moving to the south and west is the same as returning to normality. \n Thunder and rain clear the atmosphere, and a feeling of oppression is relieved. The images of springtime in the Confucian commentary refer to the gentle policy of a conquering ruler who forgives the opposition of those who cease to offer resistance."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Do what obviously needs to be done and return to stability as soon as possible. \n The Superior Man forgives, forgets, and bears no grudges. (i.e., Stability is more important than fixing blame or haggling over who is right.) \n If the thirty-ninth hexagram of Impasse is turned upside down it becomes the fortieth hexagram of Liberation or Deliverance. The two figures represent opposite situations: if Impasse creates tension, then Liberation releases it. The upper trigram of Movement ascends to escape from the lower trigram of Danger, giving us an unambiguous image of freedom and relief. \n\n\n Apart from all personification, the whole of space in which life finds itself has a malevolently spiritual character, and the \"demons\" themselves are as much spatial realms as they are persons. To overcome them is the same thing as to pass through them, and in breaking through their boundaries this passage at the same time breaks their power and achieves the liberation from the magic of their sphere. \nH. Jonas --The Gnostic Religion\n\n\n Legge's commentary in the preceding hexagram explains that the \"southwest\" is the direction of \"earth,\" the fertile lowland where life is natural and uncontrived. Confucius tells us here that an early move in this direction will win the \"allegiance of the masses.\" Psychologically interpreted, this refers to the inner kingdom of the psyche, where \u201cthe masses\u201d are the drives, emotions and archetypal complexes which make up our being. The symbolism suggests a conscious freeing up of inner tension. \n\n\n These forces, therefore, must not be left to run wild, but should be disposed of in harmless ways or, better still, used for constructive purposes: creative activities of various kinds; the rebuilding of our personality, contributing to our Psychosynthesis. \nRoberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis",

On whom besides can we lay the blame? Wilhelm/Baynes: He should really be ashamed of himself. When I myself thus attract robbers, on whom shall I lay the blame?  Blofeld:  Moreover, his using both of them was shameful. If I were to act thus and bring robbers down on me, who but myself would be to blame? Ritsema/Karcher: Truly permitting the demoniac indeed.

Wu: It is a shame for a bearer to ride in a carriage. He exposes himself to robbery. Who else is to be blamed? \nThe Master said:The makers of the I Ching may be said to have known the philosophy of robbery. The I Ching says, \"He is a burden-bearer, and yet rides in a carriage, thereby exciting robbers to attack him.\" Burden- bearing is the business of an inferior man. A carriage is the vehicle of a gentleman. When an inferior man rides in the vehicle of a gentleman, robbers will think of taking it from him. When one is insolent to those above him, and oppressive to those below, robbers will wish to attack him. Careless laying up of things excites to robbery, as a woman's adorning of herself excites to lust. What the I Ching says about the burden-bearer's riding in a carriage, and exciting robbers to attack him shows how robbery is called out. \n Legge:  The third line is magnetic where it should be dynamic. In the top place of the lower trigram it suggests the idea of a porter riding in a carriage. People will say: \"How did he get there? The things cannot be his own.\" Therefore robbers will attack and plunder him since he can't protect himself or accomplish anything good.",
        "Notes": "Siu: The man has obtained material goods and comfort and seeks a life of ease which does not suit his nature. Like a woman's self-adornment which excites to lust, this way of life merely invites robbers and leads to humiliation. \n Wing:  You have been able to assume a somewhat powerful position, which you do not know how to control. You pretend to be something that you are not. This invites envy. If you continue in this way you will suffer humiliation at the hands of others who would usurp your position. \n Editor:  Receiving this line can be a reprimand for an unworthy attitude. It shows one who aspires beyond his station, or who incorrectly seeks an easy solution to his problems. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number thirty-two,Consistency, the corresponding line of which begins: \"Shows one who does not constantly maintain his virtue...\" The idea is that a desire to move ahead quickly tempts one into an improper response to the situation at hand. Sometimes the context of the question can suggest that the \"vehicle\" (carriage) is the oracle itself -- you want it to answer a question you can figure out for yourself. The porter's burden is an obvious responsibility or duty. The robbers are anything that would harm the Work. \n\n\n The acceptance of the need to relate to a power or powers beyond our personal control and rational comprehension does not necessitate, indeed does not even permit, abandonment of our personal responsibility but rather requires of us that in the domain of the personal life assigned to us  our own responsibility must be exerted to the limits. \nE.C.

Blofeld:  A fumbled release is indicated by the unsuitable position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet an appropriate situation indeed. Cleary (2): You are not yet in the right position. Wu: Because he is out of place. \n Legge:  Line four is dynamic in a magnetic place, and his correlate is magnetic in a dynamic place. Such a union will not be productive of good. In the symbolism line one becomes the toe of line four. The K'ang-hsi editors say that \"Line four is neither central nor in his correct place. He has line one for a correlate and line three for his close associate -- both of whom are magnetic in dynamic places. Hence it is said that they are all in places inappropriate to them.\"",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man removes the inferior people who have attached themselves to him and have even become indispensable in some respects. This is a necessary prelude to great attainments. Their departure will enable him to cultivate friends with similar views and mutual confidence. \n Wing: There are people who attach themselves to you for reasons of their own. This is a parasitic relationship, which may become habitual. You should liberate yourself from this kind of entanglement, since it repels others who might be valuable allies in your endeavors. \n Editor:  The respective meanings of lines one and four are derived from their correlation with each other. Note that this correlation is seen as favorable to line one, but unfavorable to line four. There are seven lines in theI Chingwhich mention toes, and all except the present one are first lines. In this case the toe referred to is the first line, which is magnetic in a dynamic place during a time of liberation from peril or stagnation. This suggests that from the point of view of line four, his magnetic correlate in the first place is a liability to be discarded. As regards the immanent assistance of \"friends,\" Wilhelm comments that \"the present line and the [dynamic line] in the second place are friends of kindred nature, jointly rendering loyal help to the ruler in the fifth place.\" Since line two is the only other dynamic line in the hexagram and is portrayed as a \"hunter who disposes of inferior men,\" such help is obviously advantageous. As confusing as all this seems to be, the essential idea is clear enough: free yourself of a compulsion or entanglement in order to obtain help. (A toe either gives us the impetus to move or obstructs movement when we stumble over it.) Perhaps it represents a timid, conservative or over-cautious attitude which is holding us back. \n\n\n It takes a great leap of imagination to conceive of this ego position. We are so much in the habit of taking our conscious selves for granted that our sense of ourselves seems to us the primary fact from which all other experiences arise merely secondarily. We find it difficult to regard the subjective experience of \"I\" as in any way secondary, as something through which some objective \"other\" -- namely, a \"not-I,\" an objective psychic stratum -- brings itself to experience as consciousness, as a focal point of the total field in terms of space and time. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest \n\n A. Liberate yourself from egotism and allow the trustworthy insights of the Self to guide you. \n B. Control your compulsive fear or anxiety and success will come of itself. \n C. The image suggests that perhaps you have fallen in with bad company \u2013 abandon inferior influences."

Only you can save yourself. Once you are liberated, inferior elements will retreat into the background and you will win the respect you deserve.

Wilhelm renders this in a conditional sense: \"If only the superior man can deliver himself...\" Blofeld and Liu say that \"only the superior man\" can liberate himself.

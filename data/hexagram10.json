[For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happens in good humor and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all in good part. Such simplicity and unpretentiousness is faith derived from reality -- neither from love of happiness nor fear of unhappiness, but free of fear and hope. The concern here is with the art of action by means of proper conduct, and presupposes being childlike in its highest sense.]",

(Thus the superior man creates in society the differences in rank that correspond with differences in natural endowment, and in this way fortifies the thinking of the people, who are reassured when these differences accord with nature ...

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Cautious Advance we have the symbol of Weakness treading on that of Strength. The lower trigram indicates Pleasure and Satisfaction, and responds to the upper indicating Strength. Hence it is said, \"He treads on the tail of a tiger.\" The fifth line is dynamic, in the center, and in his correct place. He occupies the God-given position, and falls into no distress or failure -- his action will be brilliant.",
        "Legge": "Cautious Advance is made up of the lower trigram of Pleased Satisfaction or \"Naivet\u00e9,\" and the upper trigram of Heaven, or Primal Power. Being situated below the great symbol of Strength, Naivet\u00e9 is seen to be stepping on a tiger's tail. To emerge unscathed from such a danger depends entirely upon propriety and a strict observance of all the rules of correct behavior. On these, as so many stepping stones, one may tread safely amid scenes of disorder and peril.\n The symbol of weakness, according to Wang Shen-tzu is the third line which is urged on by the two lines below it to encounter the three strong lines above. Other commentators say that the whole lower trigram, partaking of the yin nature, is the symbol of weakness, and the entire upper trigram is symbolic of strength. The Chen-Chung editors say that to get the full meaning, we must hold both views.\n Ch'eng-tzu says of the Image: \"The sky above and a marsh lying \n below it is true in nature and reason, and so should be the rules of propriety \n on which men tread.\""
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  A cautious advance in the face of potentially volatile conditions will lead to safety.\n The Superior Man  orders his priorities realistically and gets a grip on himself.\nCautious Advance depicts the lower trigram of the joyful Youngest Daughter stepping on the heels of the upper trigram of Heaven -- the stern Pater Familias: Yahweh Saboath, or Zeus with his thunderbolt. In her innocence she doesn't realize the danger of her action. This is \"treading on the tail of the tiger,\" and the hexagram teaches us how to do this without being bitten. The original Judgment suggests that superior powers realize the innocent intent of the action, and may be inclined to be lenient.\n\n\n You should not resist fate, \n nor need you escape it; \n if you go to meet it, \n it will guide you pleasantly. \n Goethe \n\n\n Wilhelm's notes on The Image illustrate the undemocratic truth that although all men are created equal in the eyes of God, every human being possesses clearly differentiated strengths, weaknesses, talents and incapacities. In Lectures on the I Ching, he says:\n The secret of proper conduct is in inequality. Uniformity alone cannot give rise to proper conduct. To be sure, uniformity might produce rule and regulation or law and force. But tedious force and brutal law never led people to convictions that legitimately resulted in proper conduct (the term includes that which produces proper conduct and proper conduct achieved). Instead, as Confucius said: \"Force produces only alienation and people transgress secretly that which is public regulation.\"\nCautious Advance often images a test situation, or it can be a warning that you are walking on the edge of a precipice. The image of The Fool in the tarot deck has similar associations. Without changing lines, this hexagram implies a need for extreme caution, or that your actions are tempting fate.\n\n\n The passions, instead of having to be painfully exterminated, are yoked like snarling tigers to the adept\u2019s carriage. The dangers of such a course are obvious. As one of my Lama teachers put it: \"While you were traveling in that cart, a tumble would have done you little harm. Now I have given you an airplane. Don't crash in flames!\" \nJ. Blofeld -- The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet",

Blofeld:  Conducting ourselves with simplicity while advancing suggests the ability to realize our desires without aid from others. Ritsema/ Karcher: Solitarily moving desire indeed. Cleary (2): To go treading plainly means to carry out your vows alone. Wu: He is willing to go alone.\n Legge:  Line one is a dynamic line in a dynamic place, giving us the idea of activity, firmness and correctness. One so characterized will act rightly.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man is in a subordinate position without social obligation. Progress will be attained without blame if he remains content with his simple accustomed path, making no demands upon others.\n Wing:  Use your most basic values of Conduct in advancing toward your aim. Do not try to use others beyond maintaining friendly relations. Do not become obligated to others in your endeavors. Your position is low. Simplicity in your behavior will prevent mistakes and allow you to progress.\n Editor:  Wilhelm's rendition of the Confucian commentary uses the word \"solitude,\" and Blofeld emphasizes the idea of progress \"without aid from others.\" The idea is that of walking one's path alone, heedless of the external opinions of others or of the autonomous clamor of our own inner complexes. It can sometimes take the meaning of: \"Mind your own business.\"\n\n\n Let your eyes be fixed ahead, \n your gaze be straight before you. \n Let the path you tread be level \n and all your ways made firm. \n Turn neither to right nor to left, \n keep your feet clear of evil. \n Proverbs  4:25\n\n A. Stay on your accustomed path.\n B. The situation is tricky, but if you proceed with business as usual, you can avoid trouble."

        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge:  Holding the due mean, he will not allow himself to be thrown into disorder. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is central and does not get confused. Blofeld:  The recluse is a fortunate man because he cleaves to the middle path and does not allow himself to be confused. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering, not originating-from disarray indeed. Cleary (2): In the sense of not becoming personally deranged within. Wu: His mind is not disturbed from within.\n Legge:  Line two occupies the middle of the trigram, which symbolizes a path cut straight and level along a hillside or over difficult terrain. Since the fifth line is not his proper correlate, he is portrayed as a quiet and solitary man.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The quiet and solitary man apprehends the inscrutable. He seeks nothing, holds to the mean, and remains free from entanglements.\n Wing:  Maintain an ambiance of modesty and moderation. Do not harbor expectations or demands. Do not get involved with the dreams of others or hold overly ambitious goals. In this way you will meet with good fortune.\n Editor:  There seems to be little essential difference between lines one and two, except that the second line's central position emphasizes the idea of moderation and balance. When two lines in a hexagram have nearly identical meanings it is often helpful to check the corresponding hexagrams and lines created if each were the only changing line -- these will often provide clues as to their differences. In this instance, line one suggests avoiding trouble by minding one's own business; line two avoids trouble by a certain innocent faith in his destined path: a recluse or hermit who ignores the preoccupations of the crowd. Ritsema/Karcher translate \"shade\" (Wilhelm/Shaughnessy: \"dark\"), as: \"hidden from view, retired, solitary, secret; dark, obscure, occult, mysterious; ignorant.\"\n\n\n If I were possessed of Austere Knowledge \n Walking on the Main Path [of Tao], \n I would avoid the by-paths. \n The Main Path is easy to walk on, \n Yet people love the small by-paths. \n Lao-Tzu\n\n A. Stay out of sight, keep a low profile, stick to your own affairs, ignore the crowd -- balanced perception prevents confusion."

[Here the significance of the line runs counter to the benign significance of the hexagram; in all such cases, it is the line which provides the main indication of what is going to happen with regard to the matter forming the subject of the enquiry.] The warrior undertakes things for his lord.

The misfortune in the biting of the man is due to the fact that the place is not appropriate. \"Thus does a warrior act on behalf of his great prince,\" because his will is firm.\n Confucius/Blofeld:  The one-eyed man does see, but not clearly; the lame man can walk, but not keep up with the others. The disaster suffered by the man who gets bitten is indicated by this line's unsuitable position. The warrior undertakes his lord's affairs because the latter is strong of will.\n Confucius/Ritsema/Karcher:\"Squinting enabling observing.\" Not the stand to use possessing brightness indeed. \"Halting enabling Treading.\" Not the stand to use associating-with moving indeed. \"Snapping-at people's pitfall.\" Situation not appropriate indeed. \"Martial people activating: tending-towards a Great Chief.\" Purpose solid indeed.\n Confucius/Cleary(2): The squint-eyed can see, but not clearly; the lame can walk, but not well enough to be companions on a journey. The misfortune of being bitten is that of being in an inappropriate place. When a military man becomes a civil leader, his determination is adamant.\n Confucius/Wu:\u201cA person can look with one injured eye,\u201d but he cannot see clearly. \u201cA person can tread with one lame leg,\u201d but he cannot walk with firm steps. He will have the misfortune of being bitten, because his position is improper. \u201cA warrior wants to be a ruler,\u201d because his idea is adamant.\n Legge:  Line three is neither central nor in a magnetic place, which would be proper to it. But with the strength of will which the occupant of a dynamic place should possess, he goes forward with the evil results cited. The editors of the imperial edition, in illustration of the closing sentence, refer to Analects VII, x.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man recklessly exposes himself to danger, which exceeds his powers of handling. He invites disaster thereby. \n Wing:  You are not suited for the ambitiousness of your goals. Your powers are not adequate. Willfulness on your part could end in disaster. Such Conduct is only for someone willing to throw himself away for a superior.\n Editor:  The content here does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism for a magnetic line. Legge and Wu\u2019s interpretation of the line and Confucian commentary differ conceptually from the other translators. For purposes of comparison I have rendered all versions of the Confucian commentary more thoroughly than usual. As the only magnetic line in the hexagram, three is outclassed and overwhelmed, yet still serves the ruler. If this is the only changing line, The Dynamicemerges, with a corresponding line of: \"We see its subject as the superior man active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening still careful and apprehensive. The position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake.\"  The image suggests a warrior who has only partial comprehension of a dangerous situation; his ability to serve his ruler is also impeded. Despite these handicaps, his devotion is such that he will expose himself to great danger in the service of his Lord, and suffer because of it.\n\n\n If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a Samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master . \r\n           Yamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai \n\n A. The image is one of inadequate strength or resources to deal with a superior force. Regardless, the confrontation seems to be mandated: thus does the ego serve the Self.\n B. Serve the Work with a warrior's spirit: \"Yours is not to reason why, yours is but to do or die.\"\n C. Even when one's heart is in the right place, partial comprehension and insufficient ability can be expected to create distress.\n\nAlternate: This line can also suggest foolhardy arrogance rather than blind obedience to a superior. In such instances, the familiar Lady from Liger limerick seems more appropriate:\n\n\nThere was an old lady of Liger \n Who went riding on the back of a tiger. \n They came back from the ride \n With the lady inside \n And a smile on the face of the tiger.\n\n D. Incompetence plus arrogance equals disaster."

        "Legge": "Stress indicates that despite sincere motivations, one still meets with opposition and obstruction. Maintain an apprehensive caution. To prosecute the contention to the bitter end will produce evil results. It is advantageous to see the Great Man. It is not advantageous to cross the great stream.",
        "Wilhelm/Baynes": "Conflict. You are sincere and are being obstructed. A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune. Going through to the end brings misfortune. It furthers one to see the great man. It does not further one to cross the great water.",
        "Blofeld": "Conflict. Confidence accompanied by obstacles! With care, affairs can be made to prosper in their middle course, but the final outcome will be disaster. It is advantageous to visit a great man, but not to cross the great river (or sea). [In general, this hexagram indicates that we have little chance of success in any conflict, dispute or lawsuit in which we are now engaged and that retreat is the best policy -- unless line one or five is a moving line, in which case the position is more hopeful. We can profit from the advice of someone truly wise, but a journey of any kind at this time would be disastrous.]",
        "Liu": "Conflict; you have sincerity even though obstructed, stop halfway -- good fortune; follow to the end -- misfortune. It is of benefit to see a great man, but not to cross the great water.",
        "Ritsema/Karcher": "Arguing , possessing conformity. Blocking awe. \n Centering significant. Completing: pitfall. Harvesting: visualizing Great People. Not Harvesting: wading the Great River. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of a dispute. It emphasizes that actively expressing your claims and objections is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to argue!] (Sic)",
        "Shaughnessy": "Lawsuit : There is a return; pitying and tranquil, it succeeds to be auspicious, but in the end is inauspicious; beneficial herewith to see the great man; not beneficial to ford the great river.",

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "The coming together of Strength and Peril gives the idea of Stress. A dynamic line in the central place in the lower trigram shows how there will be good fortune if one maintains apprehensive caution; but because contention should not be taken to extremes, there will be evil if one prosecutes his contention to the bitter end. The great man sets a value on the due mean. If one attempts to cross the great stream, he finds himself in an abyss.",
        "Legge": "The upper trigram of Strength here controls the lower trigram of Peril which is trying to attack it. Or it may also be seen as someone in a perilous situation contending with strong outside forces. The image is of contention and strife. The sincere yang line in the middle of the trigram of Peril gives a character to the whole figure -- an individual so represented will be very cautious and have good fortune. But since contention is bad, even a sincere individual must fail if he pursues it to the bitter end. The fifth line represents the great man, whose agency is sure to be good. His decision in any matter of contention will be correct. The sixth line is also dynamic, but his action is likely to be too rash for a great enterprise, hence the warning about not attempting to cross the great stream."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Be careful, don't attempt much, and don't allow the situation to get out of hand.\n The Superior Man  is judicious about his choices of action to ensure that the situation remains stable.\n The hexagram portrays a high level of tension. Wilhelm points out that the only \"favorable\" line is the ruler in the fifth place, and that all of the other lines symbolize people quarreling. It should also be noted that lines one through four counsel either retreat from contention or remaining passively in place. Only line five suggests that an active struggle can have a favorable outcome, and line six portrays the sorry fate of those who insist on \"demanding their rights.\" If we turn the hexagram upside down we have Waiting, which suggests some subtle truths about the proper way to handle stress.\n\n\n He who has a taste for dispute has a taste for blows, \nthe man of haughty speech courts destruction. \nProverbs 17: 19\n At deciding lawsuits I am no better than anyone else; but what is necessary is to bring about a state of affairs in which there will be no lawsuits. \nConfucius\n\n\n Note that Ritsema/Karcher's summation of the Judgment stands in stark disagreement with the general tenor of the figure: I have never received this hexagram when that interpretation has applied.",
    "line_1": {
        "Legge": "The first line, magnetic, shows its subject not perpetuating the matter about which the contention is. She will suffer the small injury of being spoken against, but the end will be fortunate.",
        "Wilhelm/Baynes": "If one does not perpetuate the affair, there is a little gossip. In the end, good fortune comes.",
        "Blofeld": "Provided that affairs are not pressed through to the end and that as little as possible is said about them, they will end propitiously.",
        "Liu": "One does not continue the affair (conflict). Even if there is some gossip, good fortune in the end.",

        "Wu": "Contention can never produce results. Although there are small talks about him, the outcome will be auspicious.",
        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge:  Contention should not be prolonged. Although she may suffer the small injury of being spoken against, her argument is clear. Wilhelm/ Baynes: One must not prolong the conflict. The matter is finally decided clearly. Blofeld: This implies not dragging on a dispute. Though little should be said, its purport should be clear. Ritsema/Karcher: Arguing not permitting long-living indeed. Although the small possesses words, one's differentiation brightening indeed. Cleary (2): The explanation is clear. Wu: Clarification will bring about understanding.\n Legge: Line one is magnetic at the bottom of the figure. She may suffer somewhat in the nascent strife, but will let it drop to good effect.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man refrains from contention during the initial stages of strife. He suffers little. But he knows that he needs to walk together with his associates and cannot advance alone.\n Wing:  Your position is such that you must avoid any Conflict or terminate it quickly. Don't try to bring things to a decision or engage yourself in a dispute. You may feel a little victimized, but in the end all goes well.\n Editor:  This is a clear injunction to abandon the subject of contention or your line of questioning. The \"gossip\" sometimes refers to the inner clamoring of hurt pride or bruised ego.\n\n\n As well loose a flood as initiate legal proceedings; break off before the dispute begins. \nProverbs 17: 14\n\n A.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thus one escapes. To contend from a lowly place with someone above brings self- incurred suffering.  Blofeld: This passage means that, if we pit ourselves against superior strength, we shall find ourselves bowed beneath the dint of conflict to the bitter end. Ritsema/ Karcher: Converting escaping, skulking indeed. Below origin, above Arguing. Distress culminating, reaping indeed. Cleary (2): (None)Wu: When a subordinate brings a lawsuit against his superior; his loss is unavoidable.\n Legge: Line two is dynamic in a magnetic place and no match for his fifth-line adversary who is dynamic in a dynamic place, and the ruler to boot. That he retires from contention to an insignificant village of only three hundred people shows his humility.",

A conciliatory and timely retreat precludes personal disaster.\n Wing:  Your adversary is superior in strength. Do not allow your pride or sense of honor to draw you into open Conflict. Retreat and you will avoid a disastrous outcome for yourself and those close to you.\n Editor:  \"Discretion is the better part of valor\" -- there is nothing to be gained by fighting a battle you cannot win.\n\n\n If all the countries he knows or hears about follow a way that is not good, as in our time, or if because of military campaigns or illness, he is unable to go to a city with good customs, he shall dwell alone in solitude.

Ritsema/Karcher: Adhering-to the above significant indeed. Cleary (2): Living on past virtues is the luck of following the high. Wu: Following those above him will be auspicious.\n Legge: Here the line is magnetic in a dynamic place and thus unequal to the stress of the matter at hand. She withdraws from the arena, and even if forced into action she will stay safely in the background. \"She keeps in the old place assigned for her support\" literally means: \"She eats her own virtue.\" That is, she nourishes herself on her own natural endowment and does not contend for more than that.",

He does not engage in perilous contests over property.\n Wing:  Keep a low profile. Stick to established methods and traditional virtues. Do not put yourself in a position of prominence whatever you imagine to gain in prestige. Material possessions and status mean nothing now. Only your inner worth will be of value to you.\n Editor:\"Ancient virtues\" suggest the principles of the Work, or the archetype of the psyche as an integrated whole.

Wu: Because there will be no error.\n Legge:  Line four is dynamic in a magnetic place which is not central -- he has a mind to contend in a position from which he cannot hope to win. Above him is the strong ruler with whom it is hopeless to strive, and below him is his weak ally in the first place from whom no help can be expected. Hence he takes the course indicated, which leads to good fortune. The returning to the study of Heaven's ordinances and changing the wish to contend are not two things, but one. The ordinances are what is right in principle, and since the wish to contend was wrong in principle, it is now abandoned.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man thinks that belligerency toward his weaker opponents will succeed. But lacking righteousness, he fails in his endeavors. Returning from the path of strife to one of inner harmony with the eternal law, he finds peace and good fortune.\n Wing: You might see where you could improve your position by engaging in Conflict with a weaker element. The fact is, though, that you cannot gain inner satisfaction from such strategies. Returning to a sense of dignity and inner worth coupled with an acceptance of your fate will bring you peace of mind and good fortune.\n Editor:  Psychologically interpreted, the image suggests a situation in which the ego is not yet ready to encounter certain forces involved in the Work. The lesson is to return to an attitude of receptivity to instruction: \u201cHeaven's ordinances.\u201d\n\n\n It is proper for a man to overlook all the things of the world, for according to those who understand, everything is vain and empty and not worth taking vengeance for. \nMaimonides \n\n A.

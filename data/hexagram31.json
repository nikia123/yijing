    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Initiative is here used in the sense of mutually influencing. The magnetic trigram is above and the dynamic trigram is below -- their two influences move, respond and unite with each other. The male is placed below the female -- his repression is her satisfaction and brings fulfillment. Advantage depends upon firm correctness, as in the marrying of a young lady. Heaven and earth stimulate each other and all things attain birth. The sages stimulate the minds of men and harmony is born. If we examine the pattern of these influences, the nature of heaven and earth is revealed.",
        "Legge": "The lines of the hexagram all deal with moving or influencing to movement, and the figure is an essay on the different ways of creating an influence, and the results engendered thereby. The lower trigram of the youngest son supports the upper trigram of the youngest daughter in happy union. This is correct because the lower trigram (here yang) should always take the initiative. No influence is so powerful and constant as that between husband and wife, and where they are both young, it is especially active. Therefore, mutual influence, correct in itself, and for correct ends is sure to be effective."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Initiative succeeds only when it originates from the Self. \n The Superior Man clears his mind and remains receptive to the will of the Self. \n Wilhelm's translation of the name of this hexagram is Influence, but I have chosen Initiative to emphasize the idea of the proper source of the influence implied in the symbolism. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines initiative as follows: \n Initiative 1 : an introductory step or movement: an act designed to originate or set on foot, as a process or train of events. Often used in the phrase: on one's own initiative, as in: \"Don't blame me, he acted on his own initiative.\" \n The Judgment states that the situation can be furthered only by the firm correctness associated with the proper contracting of a marriage. We already know that the symbolism of marriage refers to a union of opposites within the psyche. To understand what is meant by the proper contracting of a marriage, we need only look at hexagram number fifty-four,Propriety (The Marrying Maiden), to see the improper way to do it -- that is, when the woman takes the initiative. \n Far from being a sexist idea, the symbolism reveals a profound archetypal truth. The polarity of forces in the psyche shows the ego as magnetic to the dynamic Self. That is, the conscious ego-complex in any psyche, male or female, is feminine, or magnetic in relation to the Self, which is masculine, or dynamic. In the I Ching the Self is symbolized by heaven, and the ego is symbolized by earth. This primordial relationship between the two qualities is found in many symbol systems. Here's the Kabbalistic version: \n\n\nThis clearly indicates the function of polarity that prevails between the planes of form and the planes of force; the planes of form being the female aspect, polarized and made fertile by the influencesof the planes of force. \nD. Fortune -- The Mystical Qabalah\n\n\n The Hermetic tradition describes it this way: \n\n\n There is this dual aspect in the mind of every person. The \"I\" [Self] represents the Masculine Principle of Mental Gender -- the \"Me\" [ego] represents the Female Principle. \nThe Kybalion \n\n\n In the contracting of a marriage between heaven and earth (uniting the polarities within the divided psyche), the ego must learn, usually through great suffering, that its correct role is a magnetic one in relation to that of the Self. The Work cannot progress until this lesson has been learned and accepted completely. As long as the ego insists on taking dynamic initiative \u201cas usual\" in the illusory world of appearances, the results can only be the kind of objective world we inhabit -- one of chaos and strife. The lesson of this hexagram then, is the realization that the only correct source of power lies with the Self, and that the ego must yield to that source as a bride to her bridegroom. (Unfortunately, the contemporary relationship between the sexes has become so confused that this metaphor is seldom effective in conveying the profound truth it represents.) \n The Self (the Causal Body of Theosophy) dwells beyond the restrictions of spacetime and is pre-eminently suited for directing the Work, since it can \"see ahead\u201d so to speak, and it knows the effects of all of the available choices. The ego, on the other hand, dwells in spacetime and is able to take action: by its choices it makes or breaks the Work. The ideal reciprocity between ego and Self is a simple and logical division of labor -- the Self can see ahead but cannot take direct action, and the ego can take direct action but cannot see ahead. For the ego to act without direction from the Self is to grope blindly in the dark -- and the Work clearly cannot progress under such circumstances. The superior man therefore, \"clears his mind and remains receptive to the will of the Self.\u201d Obviously, it takes time to learn how to do this properly; in its initial stages, that's what the Work is all about. \n\n\n The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity, environment, etc., and manifest very little freedom. They are swayed by the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy of the name. \nThe Kybalion \n\n\n The second and third sentences in the Confucian commentary elicit the sexual symbolism in this hexagram quite clearly: \"The [female] trigram is above and the [male] trigram is below -- their two influences move, respond and unite with each other. The male is placed below the female -- his repression is her satisfaction and brings fulfillment.\u201d Blofeld comments on this in a footnote: \n\n\n I doubt if this should be regarded as shedding light upon the ancient Chinese concept of the most acceptable position for intercourse; it is more likely to mean that the girl is able to depend upon the man as a plant depends upon the earth for its nourishment. \n\n\n Symbolism works on many levels, and Blofeld's aborted insight does apply to some of them. It is an established fact that the sentences in question accurately describe tantric sexual techniques practiced in the Orient for millennia. To understand the principles of the Work we must be able to see the \"obvious\" as symbolic of an abstraction -- and vice- versa. Sexual polarity is a very tricky and volatile symbol because we are predisposed to confine it to its most literal meaning. The hardest part of symbolic interpretation is to know where in the continuum a specific symbol belongs in any given situation. \n Without changing lines this hexagram suggests that you examine your impulses and motivations to act and see if they are truly in accordance with the goals of the Work. The figure can sometimes take on the meaning of importuning: \"to press or urge with frequent or unreasonable requests or troublesome persistence.\u201d In other words, you might be importuning the oracle for answers which it is of no mind to give you. It is also significant to note that every line has a more or less negative connotation. These are all very strong warnings to the ego to control its compulsive need to take the Initiative, to influence the situation. Calm down -- reality is not what it appears to be. Please allow the Self to direct the Work. \n\u00a0\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION \n Compare the concepts in this hexagram with hexagram number fifty-four,Propriety; number fifty-three, Gradual Progress; and number eleven, Harmony. How do they all deal with the symbol of marriage as an aspect of the Work? Compare the first three lines with hexagram number 52,Keeping Still. \nInitiativeis the first hexagram of Part II of the I Ching. Why do you suppose the book was divided into two unequal sections? Why did the division appear between the thirtieth and thirty-first hexagrams? (An even division would be between the thirty-second and thirty-third.) \n\n\n The (I Ching) was originally divided into two books. (Appendix VI) considers the first of these as dealing with the world of nature, and the second as dealing with that of man. \nFung Yu-Lan -- A Short History of Chinese Philosophy\n\n\n What insights does the alchemical concept of the Unus Mundus bring to bear on these questions?",

Wilhelm's commentary suggests the idea of a hidden influence, a latent force within the situation, which has not yet become apparent. This energy is focused on what is beyond itself -- i.e., it wants to become manifest, but as yet is not powerful enough to do so. (There is a suggestion of impatience to take action.) At its most neutral, the line can image a concern with something distant in time or space -- even an abstract idea.

Wilhelm/Baynes: For he cannot keep still. When the will is directed to things that one's followers hold to, this is very base. Blofeld: Sensation in the thighs also denotes restlessness; while being guided by the will of a wife (or subordinate) involves clinging to what is inferior.  Ritsema/Karcher: Truly not abiding indeed. Purpose located-in following people. A place to hold-on-to the below indeed. Cleary (2): Is also not staying put; the aim is in following others; what is clung to is low. Wu: Like his predecessors, he does not want to stay put either. His desire to follow people shows whatever he holds is low. \n Legge:  The attempt to move the thighs is inauspicious. The dynamic third line, in a dynamic place, wants to run after line four, which is said here to be the seat of the mind. He exercises his influence with an inferior purpose. \"What he holds in his grasp is low\" is understood to refer to the magnetic first and second lines. \"Following\" leads the mind to the lines above. \"Low\" is understood in the sense of \"mean.\"",
        "Notes": "Siu:  A person should refrain from running after those he would like to influence, yielding to the whims of his master, and acquiescing to the moods of his own heart. Personal inhibition should constitute the basis for the enjoyment of granted freedom. \n Wing: You must gain control of yourself. Don't run this way and that on impulse in an attempt to influence others or indulge in your many whims. You will ultimately be humiliated by such unconsidered actions. Set up a few inhibitions for yourself and operate within these limitations while you develop some self-control. \n Editor:  Mr. Legge, a proper Victorian, did not bring out the earthy imagery of this line to its fullest. If we were to receive this image in a dream it might take the blatantly sexual form of the pelvic thrusting associated with male dogs. When seen in this way the idea behind this line becomes clear. \n\n\n Hence it is that in men the privy member is disobedient and self-willed, like a creature that will not listen to reason, and because of frenzied appetite bent upon carrying all before it. In women again, for the same reason, what is called the matrix or womb, a living creature within them with a desire for childbearing, if it be left unfruitful beyond the due season, is vexed and aggrieved, and wandering throughout the body and blocking the channels of the breath, by forbidding respiration brings the sufferer to extreme distress and causes all manner of disorders; until at last the Eros of the one and the Desire of the other bring the pair together, pluck as it were the fruit from the tree and sow the plowland of the womb with living creatures still unformed and too small to be seen. \nPlato -- The Timaeus\n\n A. The image suggests a mindless and compulsive urge to influence the situation. \n B. You allow yourself to be influenced by base emotions."

Wilhelm/ Baynes: In this way one does not stir up anything injurious. Thoughts going hither and thither in agitation: by this one shows that one has as yet no clear light. Blofeld: Persistence rewarded and the vanishing of regret both result from our not having incited anyone to evildoing, but this irresolute conduct scarcely indicates clarity of mind on our part.

Wu: He has not done anything brilliant. \nFrom the Great Treatise -- It is said in the I Ching: \"Full of anxious thoughts you go and come; only friends will follow you and think with you.\" The Master said: \"In all the processes taking place under heaven, what is there of thinking? What is there of anxious scheming? They all come to the same successful issue, though by different paths. There is one result, though there might be a hundred anxious schemes. What is there of thinking? What is there of anxious scheming?\u201d \n Legge:  Line four is dynamic, but in a magnetic and receptive place. It is the \n seat of the mind, and its subject is therefore warned to be firm and correct in order to get a good issue. If he is wavering and uncertain, his influence won't extend beyond his circle of friends. \n Wilhelm/Baynes: This is a strong line in a weak place, hence it has a twofold possibility. It can remain firm and, resisting the temptation to use special influence, quietly make itself felt as one of the rulers of the hexagram, by virtue of its character; in this case it does not stimulate anything injurious, since it is in harmony with the right. Or it can instead yield to the influence of the six at the beginning, to which it is related. Thereby it limits its influence; everything is shifted onto the conscious plane, and the inner light darkens.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  No harm has yet been incurred from a selfish wish to influence. But neither is the man's power of any great consequence. He is too indecisive and unsure of himself to move anyone beyond his own circle of friends. \n Wing:  The desire to influence a specific person or situation is now enhanced. Do not become calculating or manipulative in your efforts. Instead, take a unilateral approach by displaying the strength of your convictions in all that you do. By remaining consistent in all matters you will achieve your goal. \n Editor: The Confucian commentary from the Great Treatise hints at the subtle truth behind this line. When the ego has attained true tranquility, all initiative comes directly from the Self. If the ego is \"unsettled in its movements,\" only its \"friends\" (analogous complexes within the psyche) will respond. Sometimes the message here is to have the discipline not to meddle with a natural process. \n\n\n As long as the heart has not attained absolute tranquility, it cannot move itself ... If, when stimulated by external things, one moves, it is the impulse of the being. If, when not stimulated by external things, one moves, it is the movement of heaven ... When no idea arises, the right ideas come ... When things are quiet and one is quite firm, and the release of heaven suddenly moves, is this not a movement without purpose? Action through non-action has just this meaning. \nThe Secret of the Golden Flower \n\n A. Restlessness prevents unity -- calm down and unify your thinking or focus your intent. \n B.

Wu: He likes chattering. \n Legge:  Line six is magnetic in a magnetic place at the top of the trigram of Frivolity. Her influence by means of speech will only be that of garrulous flattery.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man resorts to superficial ways of influencing others through nothing but talk. The results are negligible. \n Wing:  Words are only words. Ideas mean little unexecuted. What are you doing? \n Editor: The divided line at the top of the upper trigram is said to symbolize an open mouth. To talk is to use words, and words are a product of the mental realm. The image is of empty rhetoric -- perhaps a too-intellectual approach to the situation at hand. This blather can be inner as well as outer, and the line sometimes refers to the excesses of reason and logic which can blind us to the truths of an expanded awareness. Often in the course of the Work we are severely tested by choices which demand the abandonment of common sense in favor of faith in the Self to carry us to a realm transcending reason. Such tests are excruciating, and often we fail them because we cannot let go of our faith in logic, words and \"common sense.\" Compare with line five of Hexagram 52. \n\n\n I gradually form the habit of listening inwardly, whenever I want to say something, to be sure I have authority to say it. Gradually I learn to keep my mouth shut except when I really have something to say. And I come to recognize two beings in my self: a personal ego which is often inclined to chatter, without control, purely for the sake of communicating and attracting attention to my person -- and in the background of my consciousness a higher self which restrains my personal ego, telling it when and what it is to speak or do, and when it is to remain silent or passive. The important thing is to pay attention and obey the orders of this higher self. Merely to hear its commands is not enough; everybody does that! \nElisabeth Haich -- Initiation \n\n A. An image of rationalization or intellectual drivel. Your idea is without merit. \n\n May 8, 2001, 3/25/06"

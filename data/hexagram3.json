    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Difficultyis experienced as Heaven and Earth begin their intercourse, but correct action succeeds in the face of danger. By the action of thunder and rain, which are the attributes of the lower and upper trigrams, all between Heaven and Earth is filled up. But the conditions of the time are irregular and obscure. Authority should be delegated, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged in even then.",
        "Legge": "The written character for Difficultyis pictorial, and shows a plant struggling with difficulty as it rises above the surface of the earth. This initial difficulty is a metaphor for how struggle is the condition of a state which is emerging from disorder after a revolution. The author saw his social and political world in great disorder and difficult to reform, yet he had faith in himself and the destiny of his House. Let there be prudence and caution, with unswerving adherence to the right. Let the government of the different states be entrusted to good and able men -- then all will be well.\n According to the arrangement of the eight trigrams, Heaven and Earth are the parents of the other six, who are their children. The first-born son is the lower trigram of Movement, and the second-born son is the upper trigram of Peril. McClatchie renders here: \"The figure of Difficulty represents the hard and the soft beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering.\"\n The power to move in the lower trigram is likely to produce great effects; to do this in perilous and difficult circumstances (symbolized by the upper trigram) requires firmness and correctness. Good princes throughout the realm will help to remedy the political and social disorder of the times, but the supreme ruler should not trust his subordinates to the point of relaxing his vigilance.\n The lower trigram represents thunder, the upper represents rain clouds. The hexagram therefore places us in the atmosphere of a thunderstorm -- a metaphor for the situation of a political state in difficulty. When the thunder has pealed, and the clouds have discharged their burden of rain, the atmosphere is cleared and there is a feeling of relief.\n Anthony: This hexagram means that we have not yet found the correct path. \n It also means confusion: too many possibilities. Nothing is clear. This lack of clarity is the \u201chindrance\u201d referred to in the first line of the hexagram. In the second line, the remedies that come forth are inappropriate. In the first stages of dealing with a problem, we are tempted to grasp at solutions, whereas we should wait until the proper actions become clear."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Under the conditions of Difficulty it is best to mark time while seeking assistance.\n The superior man  uses careful analysis to separate order from confusion.\n Wilhelm\u2019s title for this hexagram is Difficulty at the Beginning. I prefer Difficulty, because it is a situation encountered at any phase of the Work, not just the beginning.\n Difficulty is experienced because confusion and multiplicity prevail during the initial phase of any creative activity -- thoughts and feelings proliferate and threaten to overwhelm the mind with infinite complexity. The only way to proceed under such circumstances is to carefully sort out the components of the situation and arrange them in categories and in order of importance. To \"sort the threads of the warp and woof\" is to weave a tangled mess into a tapestry. \n The Orderly Sequence of the Hexagrams gives us an image of what takes place under the hexagram of Difficulty:\n\n\n When there were Heaven and Earth, then afterwards all things were produced. What fills up the space between Heaven and Earth are those individual things. Hence the Dynamic and Magnetic are followed by Difficulty. Difficulty means filling up.\n\n\n\"Filling up,\" is rendered as \"fullness\" in some translations. This is the exact meaning of the gnostic term: \"Pleroma,\" or \"Fullness\" which Jung correlates with the Collective Unconscious or Objective Psyche. These are interior dimensions from which emanate the archetypal energies which we experience as instinctual drives and emotional complexes. This is the \"hyperspace\" from which the Self, via the oracle, responds to our queries and directs the Work.\n Thus we see that the third hexagram, following the creation of the cosmic pair of opposites in the first two figures, represents a dialectical progression. Lao Tse, who wrote the Tao Te Ching some six-hundred years after the I Ching was committed to writing, describes this unfolding process: \n\n\nOut of Tao, One is born; \n Out of One, Two; \n Out of Two, Three; \n Out of Three, the created universe. \n The created universe carries the yin at its back \n and the yang in front; \n Through the union of their pervading principles \n it reaches harmony.\n\n\n The identical idea is found in many traditions, giving it the status of an archetype within human consciousness. It is not necessary to be familiar with the technical terminology of Kabbalah to recognize that the same idea is being discussed in the following passage:\n\n\n In Chokmah and Binah we have the archetypal Positive and Negative; the primordial Maleness and Femaleness, established while \"countenance beheld not countenance\" and manifestation was incipient ... It is between these two polarizing aspects of manifestation -- the Supernal Father and the Supernal Mother -- that the web of life is woven; souls going back and forth between them like a weaver's shuttle. In our individual lives, in our physiological rhythms, and in the history of the rise and fall of nations, we observe the same rhythmic periodicity.\nD. Fortune --The Mystical Qabalah \n\n\n This idea has been stated very simply: \n\n\n All things are a single form which has divided and multiplied in time and space.\nW.B. Yeats -- A Vision\n Is not the sky a father and the earth a mother, and are not all living things with feet or wings or roots their children? \n--  Black Elk\n\n\n And also with poetic complexity: \n\n\n In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit hovered over the water ... God said, \"Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth within the vault of heaven.\" And so it was ... God blessed them, saying, \"Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas; and let the birds multiply upon the earth.\nGenesis\n\n\n There are some profound ideas in these images about the structure of human consciousness and the contents of the unconscious psyche. The basic idea is that of Emanation -- the creation of physical reality from a supreme principle in ordered hierarchies of increasing complexity. This concept is essential for a full understanding of the Work.\n\n\n The involution of man was his descent from the sphere of the spirit, developing bodies of a mental, emotional and then physical nature until he manifested upon this planet. His evolution is to civilize this planet and to develop mastery of the physical, emotional and mental planes and relink himself in unity with God once more, thus completing the cycle. He came from God as an inexperienced Spark of Divine Fire and returns to Him, with all the experience of manifestation, as a Lord of Humanity. \nGareth Knight -- The Work of a Modern Occult Fraternity\n\n\n In many systems of thought, the proliferation of forces is seen in sexual terms -- the cosmic parents produce entities in male and female pairs (gnostic syzygies), which in turn produce offspring. Hence, Confucius says: \"Difficulty is experienced as Heaven and Earth begin their intercourse.\" That this has an explicit sexual connotation is confirmed by McClatchie: \"The figure of Difficulty represents the hard and the soft beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering.\" Thus we see that the correct and incorrect correlation (\"intercourse\") of dynamic (male) and magnetic (female) lines in anyI Ching hexagram symbolizes the favorable (life-enhancing) or unfavorable (life-negating) combinations of thought and feeling within the psyche. \n\u00a0 \n SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION\n The sexual intercourse of Heaven and Earth is also described in hexagram number eleven,Harmony. In terms of these sexual metaphors, what does the term \"adultery\" imply in regard to the Work? See hexagram number forty-four, Temptation, for further insight on this theme.",

        "Wu": "There is a formidable obstruction to advance. It will be advantageous, however, to remain persevering \u2026 etc. [If the subject can remain firm and correct, he will overcome.]",
        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge: Although there is difficulty in advancing, the mind of the subject of the line is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people. Wilhelm/Baynes: The aim of the work is nonetheless to carry out what is right. When an eminent man subordinates himself to his inferiors, he wins the hearts of all people. Blofeld:  Despite prevailing uncertainty, the way of righteousness must be pursued with firm correctness. Men in high places, by co-operating with those under their care, will thereby win the support of the people. Ritsema/Karcher: Although a stone pillar, purpose moving correctly indeed. Using valuing the mean below. The great acquiring the commoners indeed. Cleary(2): Though they stay around, the action of their wills is correct. Because they value the lowly, they win many people. Wu: Although he is under constraint, he has set his goal correctly. Like a noble man serving the common people, he will receive their support.\n Legge:  The first line is energetic and strong, and his place in the trigram of Movement disposes him to action. But above him is the trigram of Peril, and the lowest line of that, to whom he must look for response and cooperation, is magnetic. Hence arise the ideas of difficulty in advancing, the necessity of caution, and the advantage of being clothed with authority. He is noble, firm and correct, but his place is below the divided lines, symbols of the weak and lowly.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man takes stock of the obstacles. He does not force his advance. He perseveres on the right course and acquires the appropriate assistants. He continuously rechecks his bearings, as the confusion is gradually resolved.\n Wing:  It seems that you have come across a confusing obstacle at the very beginning of your path. The best way to attract the helpers you will need is to maintain a devoted and humble attitude. Do not attempt to boldly push ahead unaided. However, do keep your goal in sight.\n Editor: The symbolism suggests the following intrapsychic correlations: \n Advance: The advance of consciousness, comprehension, etc. Feudal Ruler: The ego as master of its thoughts and feelings. \"Humbles himself to the mean\": (\"Mean\" here means \"lowly.\") The ego remains firm and correct, maintains his will, but doesn't take on airs -- he nurtures his humility. The people: Thoughts, feelings, opinions, attitudes, emotions, appetites, etc.\n\n\n The optimal stance that the ego can strive for--without necessarily hoping that it can ever be accomplished fully -- could be described as a continual awareness of the conflicting polarities likely to appear in ever- new forms as old ones are resolved: of waiting and seeing, of living things out, weighing various aspects and bringing them into balance, ever ready to work with the materials at hand.\n E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest\n\n A. There are intimidating obstructions to progress. Remain persevering while seeking assistance. If you subordinate yourself to your situation you\u2019ll gain insight into its nature. Take no major action.\n B. A difficult path demands impeccable will and full acceptance of responsibility."

        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge:  Her difficulty arises from her place over the dynamic line below her. The union and children after ten years shows things resuming their regular course. Wilhelm/Baynes: She rests upon a rigid line. Pledging herself after ten years means return to the general rule.  Blofeld: The difficulties are revealed by this weak line's position just above a firm one. Waiting for ten years to receive the beloved's consent implies awaiting a gradual return to normal conditions. Ritsema/Karcher: Six at second's heaviness. Riding a solid indeed. Ten years-revolved, thereupon nursing. Reversing rules indeed. Cleary(2): Riding on the obdurate. Getting married after ten years means return to normal. Wu: Riding on the strong-minded first nine. A return to normalcy.\n Legge:  Advance is even more difficult for the second line than for line one. She is magnetic, and pressed by the dynamic line below her. Above, in the fifth line is the ruler with whom union should be properly sought. All these circumstances suggest the idea of a young lady sought in marriage by a strong suitor with whom marriage was unsuitable. She rejects him, and after ten years marries the only suitable match for her. \"Things resume their regular course\" means that she is now at liberty to seek a union with line five.",
        "Notes": "Siu: Progress is further inhibited. Someone suddenly appears who is mistaken for a robber at first but actually turns out friendly. His offer of help is not to be accepted. Not being from the right quarter, it may entail undesirable obligations. Things will resume their regular course at the proper time.\n Wing:  Confusion and difficulty mount, and decisions become impossible. To allow yourself to accept help will create a hindering obligation. Therefore it is best to wait until the situation returns to normal before you continue your pursuits.\n Editor:  Horses are a common symbol for energy or libido (\"horsepower\"). Women and men respectively represent Eros (emotion) and Logos (intellect). These attributes are consistent throughout the I Ching, and are common in almost all symbol systems. In this line the man is seen as an unsuitable match for the woman, psychologically suggesting an improper union of thoughts and feelings, or the temptation to an emotional rationalization of some sort. The situation is confused and up in the air: psychic energy is in a state of regression, and we are tempted to accept the first solution that comes along. Under such circumstances no progress can be made until things are allowed to settle down. The \"ten years\" refer to any fulfilled cycle of time.\n\n\n I use Eros and Logos merely as conceptual aids to describe the fact that woman's consciousness is characterized more by the connective quality of Eros than by the discrimination and cognition associated with Logos. In men, Eros, the function of relationship, is usually less developed than Logos. \nJung -- Aion\n\n A. Image of an unsettled situation. Resolution of the problem is not possible now, despite your desire for it. Later on, the situation will resolve itself naturally.\n B.

He gives up the senseless chase and avoids eventual disgrace.\n Wing:  You can sense the difficulties that lie ahead on your path. If you nevertheless plunge into the forest of obstacles without an experienced guide, you will surely lose your way. Such egotism and vanity brings unrelenting humiliation. A wiser man will alter his goals here.\n Editor:  Forest symbolism is usually associated with the feminine principle and the unconscious psyche. A deer, being a denizen of the forest, could symbolize an undifferentiated, unassimilated, autonomous force within the situation at hand. As the object of the quest, it represents the answer to a question, a solution to your problem, etc. To complete the metaphor, the forester would be your intuition or inner guide: the Self. The message is that you have no insight into the prevailing situation and should stop trying to force a solution. Cease your fruitless speculation and wait for the way to become clear.\n\n\n It is only when the human being really knows what he is doing that he can be called self-conscious and responsible. The person who is guided by his ego alone is not self-conscious in this sense, for he is limited in his self-knowledge to the conscious realm only, and beyond this terrain yields himself blindly to the obscure urges and devious impulses of the unconscious. \nM.E.

It can also image a situation in which psychic energy is blocked from consciousness.\n\n\n The attributes of the spirit are not only beyond the power of sensual perception, but they are beyond the power of intellectual comprehension; they can only be known to the spirit, and they are called occult because they cannot be understood without the possession of the light of the spirit.\nF. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies \n\n A. Conserve your energy. Take only limited action, one step at a time; allow the situation to unfold at its own pace.\n B. Obstructions inherent in the situation prevent the flow of information needed to comprehend it. To strive too hard is to lose it altogether.\n C. Integral obstacles inhibit an immediate resolution of the situation at hand."

You can no longer see your initial difficulties realistically, nor can you find your way out. This is disgraceful and will cause you much regret. It is best to begin again.\n Anthony: Desire and fear prevail. The child in us rules. Despairing, we give up our path. \u201cOne should not persist in this.\u201d\n Editor:  Lines two, four and six all show horses in retreat: strong images of psychological turmoil and confusion; two and four have proper correlates however, so they present the possibility of at least some kind of reconciliation. Here, the correlate is line three, who is depicted as being \"lost in the woods.\u201d At its most neutral, the image is one of severe disunion. Wilhelm and Blofeld state that the situation is not a lasting one, so all need not be lost if you seek a totally new and perhaps currently unrecognized connection.\n\n\n In our ordinary life we are limited and bound in a thousand ways -- the prey of illusions and phantasms, the slaves of unrecognized complexes, tossed hither and thither by external influences, blinded and hypnotized by deceiving appearances. No wonder then that man, in such a state, is often discontented, insecure and changeable in his moods, thoughts and actions. Feeling intuitively that he is \"one,\" and yet finding that he is \"divided unto himself,\" he is bewildered and fails to understand either himself or others. No wonder that he, not knowing or understanding himself, has no self- control and is continually involved in his own mistakes and weaknesses; that so many lives are failures, or are at least limited and saddened by diseases of mind and body, or tormented by doubt, discouragement and despair. \nRoberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis\n\n A. Severe disunion prevails, but need not be permanent if you seek a totally new connection.\n B. You have missed the point entirely. \n\n June 14, 2001, 4/10/06"

This hexagram represents practicing obedience in unfavorable circumstances, adaptably keeping to the Tao. The situation may be up to others, but creation of destiny is up to oneself.

        "Wu": "Regulation indicates pervasiveness. Excessive regulation should not be obstinately pursued. [Sometimes the meaning of conservation or moderation is implied. Although the idea of regulation is convincing, it should not be applied blindly without regard to conditions.]"

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Progress and attainment are seen in the equally divided dynamic and magnetic lines, with the dynamic lines in the central places. If the regulations are severe and difficult, the course of action will come to an end. We see a cheerful attitude directing the course amidst peril. The rules are correctly initiated by the ruler in the fifth place. Heaven and earth observe their regular cycles and complete the four seasons. When rulers frame their laws according to just limitations, the resources of the state suffer no injury, and the people receive no hurt.",
        "Legge": "The written Chinese character which denotes Restrictive Regulations means the regular division of a whole, such as the division of the seasons of the year into ninety-day periods clearly marked by the solstices and equinoxes. Whatever makes regular division may be denominated by a \"restrictive regulation,\" and there enter into it the ideas of ordering and restraining. The hexagram deals with the regulations of government enacted for the guidance and control of the people. An important point is made that these regulations must be adapted to the circumstances and not made too strict and severe. \n Ch'eng-tzu says on the Image: \"The water which a lake or marsh will contain is limited to a certain quantity. If the water flowing in exceeds that amount, it overflows. This gives us the idea of Restrictive Regulations.\""
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Restrictive Regulations are necessary for growth, but severe restriction must itself be limited. \n The Superior Man differentiates his options in relation to the goals of the Work. \n The Work itself is nothing if not a rigid structure imposed upon one's life -- a \"restrictive regulation\" of the ego's illusion of freedom of choice. Ordinary people insist that their lives are ordered by the intelligent exercise of free will, but this \"freedom\" is more commonly just a rationalization for the activity of autonomous complexes. No one can look objectively at the current state of the world and seriously claim that it reflects either rational order or balanced perception. Collective human experience on this planet is determined by the whims of archetypal forces expressing themselves through the unconscious psyches of six-billion people. \n The Work then, is a restrictive regulation of these autonomous forces -- it is a limitation, a containment of the expression of instinct and desire. We are reminded of the alchemical vessel which is hermetically sealed to prevent its contents from escaping before they have been transmuted into gold. If the alchemist miscalculates his \"methods of numbering and measurement\" the vessel becomes a kind of bomb: the seal breaks, the contents explode, and the Work is ruined. This is what is meant by \"if the regulations are severe and difficult, the course of action will come to an end.\"  If we restrict the contents of the vessel beyond their capacity for confinement the psyche boils over in some degree of rebellion. This is no minor thing -- depending on the circumstances, severe psychotic reactions can be created in this manner. \n On the other hand, the ego thinks that all but the most minor restrictions are severe and difficult, and it is constantly on the verge of rebellion. As always, it is the Self which must determine how far the restrictive regulations can be taken. From its perspective outside of spacetime it is best able to determine how much pressure the psyche can take -- frequently it is far more (or sometimes far less) than the ego thinks possible. \n The Confucian commentary observes: \"We see a cheerful attitude directing the course amidst peril.\" This refers to the lower trigram of Cheerfulness encountering the upper trigram of Peril or Danger. The restrictions of the Work are more often than not unpleasant and risky, constantly verging on some kind of an explosion. An attitude of cheerful acceptance enables one to survive these difficult trials. This is an extremely important concept, because without it one can all too easily fall into a suicidal despair. The Work can become an impossible burden unless one learns how to approach stress and hardship with an almost irreverent sense of humor. (This in itself is an essential lesson about how to purge the ego of its myopic notions of what it will and will not \"accept\" in life.) \n There is an old Zen proverb that says: \"Hell, also, is a place to live in.\" The message is clear: be of good cheer, because without it you are sure to fail. \n\n\n The seeming inevitability of conflict among the archetypal \"powers\" can cause us to experience life as a hopeless, senseless impasse. But the conflict can also be discovered to be the expression of a symbolic pattern still to be intuited. It can be lived as if it were a drama, the play of life or of the gods, for the purpose of experiencing an ultimate meaning ... When one can feel with Goethe that \"everything transient is but a symbol,\" then meaning can be found not only in creativity, joy and love but also in impasse, suffering and conflict. Then life can be lived as a work of art. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest",

Blofeld: He acts thus from his knowledge of when things can be carried through to their end and when they will be blocked. [The implication is that we should now hold back.]Ritsema/Karcher: Knowing interpenetrating clogging indeed. Cleary (2): Not leaving home is knowing passage and obstruction. Wu: He knows what can be done and what cannot be. \n The Master said: \"When disorder arises, it will be found that ill-advised speech was the stepping stone to it. If a ruler does not keep secret his deliberations with his minister, he will lose that minister. If a minister does not keep secret his deliberations with his ruler, he will lose his life. If important matters in the germ are not kept secret, that will be injurious to their accomplishment. Therefore the superior man is careful to maintain secrecy, and does not allow himself to speak.\" \n Legge: Line one is dynamic in a dynamic place, and therefore has the power to move. But he is kept in check by the dynamic second line, and his fourth line correlate occupies the first position in the trigram of Peril. He therefore knows when he has free course and when he is obstructed, and in this case the course of wisdom is to keep still. He regulates himself by a consideration of the times. The Daily Lecture says that the line tells an officer not to take office rashly, but to exercise a cautious judgment in his measures.",
        "Notes": "Wilhelm/Baynes:  Often a man who would like to undertake something finds himself confronted by insurmountable limitations. Then he must know where to stop. If he rightly understands this and does not go beyond the limits set for him, he accumulates an energy that enables him, when the proper time comes, to act with great force. Discretion is of prime importance in preparing the way for momentous things. \u2026We see locked doors ahead and therefore hold back. \n Siu: At the outset, the man appreciates his own limitations and exercises judicious discretion in not pressing beyond them. He does not exert his authority rashly. \n Wing:  Although you would like to take certain measures in the current pursuit of your aims, when you see obstacles ahead you must stop. Such Limitations should be recognized and accepted. Stay within the limits and collect your strength quietly. \n Editor: If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number twenty-nine, Danger. Obviously, \"discretion is the better part of valor\" -- one should stay put and not act. \n\n\n Never set your foot on the path of the wicked, do not walk the way that the evil go. \r\n          Avoid it, do not take it, turn your back on it, pass it by. \nProverbs 4: 14 \n\n A.

[It is salutary to regret lack of restraint in ourselves or others.] Ritsema/Karcher: Furthermore whose fault indeed? Cleary (2): Whose fault is the lament that comes from lack of regulation? Wu: He laments for being not able to conserve. Who else is to blame?\n Legge:  Line three should be dynamic, but is magnetic, and neither central nor correct. She has no proper correlate, and is the topmost line in the trigram of Complacent Satisfaction. She refuses the restrictive regulations and will discover her mistake after it is too late. She knows by her lamentations that she only has herself to blame.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man does not follow promulgated laws in his own activities. His actions lead to regret. \n Wing:  Your extravagant behavior and lack of restraint have led you into a state of difficulty. If you are now feeling regret over this and not busy placing the blame elsewhere, you will avoid further mistakes. \n Editor: Wilhelm says: \"No blame,\" and Blofeld says: \"No error.\" These renderings seem misleading, since Legge's admonition: \"But there will be no one to blame but herself\" is more in harmony with the line's meaning. Wilhelm's commentary paradoxically acknowledges this: \"But one has oneself to blame for this result.\"  The line is often given in the conditional sense: \"If you don't observe the proper regulations, you'll be sorry.\" \n\n\n A healthy mind is a castle that cannot be invaded without the will of its master; but if [evil spirits] are allowed to enter, they excite the passions of men and women, they create cravings in them, they produce bad thoughts which act injuriously upon the brain; they sharpen the animal intellect and suffocate the moral sense. Evil spirits obsess only those human beings in whom the animal nature is preponderating. Minds that are illuminated by the spirit of truth cannot be possessed; only those who are habitually guided by their own lower impulses may become subjected to their influence. \nParacelsus -- De Ente Spirituali\n\n A.

Ritsema/Karcher: Residing-in the situation: centering indeed. Cleary (2): The position one is in is balanced. Wu: His central position. \n Legge:  Line five is dynamic and in his correct place. He has no proper correlate, and so regulates himself. But he is the lord of the hexagram, and his influence is everywhere beneficially felt.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  Before exacting obedience from others, the man in a high position first applies the restrictions to himself. His beneficial influence is widely felt. \n Wing: In influencing others you must become an example. When Limitations and restrictions are necessary, take them upon yourself first. In this way you are certain that they are acceptable while you win the praise and emulation of others. Good fortune. \n Editor: If we don't impose restrictions on ourselves, we are not likely to influence others to do so: \"Handsome is as handsome does.\" In many contexts, the line can suggest a situation in which one may advance only by clearly differentiating its inherent limitations. \n\n\n But animals which live in pure nature never overdo anything, neither sex nor food nor anything else, because their patterns of behavior always impose the right measure and the moment to stop. The moment to start and the moment to stop is all built into their behavioral system, which is why Jung always said that animals were much more pious and religious than man because they really obey their inner order and really follow the meaning of what they are meant to be, never going beyond that. \nM.L.

Cleary (2): That path comes to an impasse. Wu: Excessive regulation is foreboding, because it goes nowhere. \n Legge: Line six is magnetic, in its proper place. She must be supposed to possess an exaggerated desire for enacting regulations. They will be too severe, and the effect will be evil. But as Confucius says in the Analects 3:3, it is not so great a fault as to be easy and remiss. It may be remedied, and cause for repentance will disappear.",
        "Notes": "Siu: The man exhibits an exaggerated desire for restrictive regulations. This will not be endured for long by the people. However, ruthless severity may, at times, be the only protection against temptation and irresolution and may eliminate later cause for repentance. \n Wing:  Excessive restrictions demanded of others will eventually meet with resentment. Nothing worthwhile can be accomplished in this way. However, for your own benefit, you may require severe restraints for a time to aid in your self-development and to help you avoid regretful mistakes. \n Editor: In terms of the Work, this is an extremely tricky line demanding subtle interpretation. The first two sentences are a rephrasing of the Judgment; the last sentence is a disclaimer telling us that excessive regulations are acceptable after all. This juxtaposition of contradictory ideas suggests a test situation: it is left entirely up to the querent where to draw the line. In the absence of contrary data it is usually safe to side with Confucius as described in Legge's commentary. On the other hand, it must also be recognized that extreme restriction is not the middle way, hence can only be useful as a strategic temporary measure, not as a way of life. \n\n\n Sacrifice is necessary. If nothing is sacrificed nothing is obtained. And it is necessary to sacrifice something precious at the moment, to sacrifice for a long time and to sacrifice a great deal. But still, not forever. This must be understood because often it is not understood. Sacrifice is necessary only while the process of crystallization is going on. When crystallization is achieved, renunciations, privations, and sacrifices are no longer necessary. \nGurdjieff \n\n A. You are limiting yourself, but it is OK. \n B.

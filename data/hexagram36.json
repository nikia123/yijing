    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "The image of Brightness entering into the midst of the earth suggests clarity that has been wounded or obscured. The lower trigram shows Clarity, the upper Docility. King Wen had both of these qualities, yet he was involved in great difficulties. The individual concerned should obscure his brightness. Thus was Count Chi able to correctly maintain his mind and intent amidst the difficulties of his situation.",
        "Legge": "This hexagram shows an able officer going forth in the service of his country, notwithstanding the occupancy of the throne by a weak and unsympathetic ruler. Hence the name Clouded Perception or Intelligence Wounded -- that is, injured and oppressed. The lesson of the figure is to show how such an officer will conduct himself and maintain his purpose. \n King Wen was not of the line of Shang. Though opposed and persecuted by its sovereign, he could pursue his own course, till his line came in the end to supersede the other. It could not be so with the Count of Chi, who was a member of the House of Shang. He could do nothing that would help on its downfall."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Recognize a difficult situation and use your willpower to cope with its restrictions. \n The Superior Man manages the situation by subduing his need to speculate, meddle, or call attention to himself. (Alternate: When in the presence of arrogance, the wise man plays the fool.) \n The thirty-fifth hexagram shows the trigram of Clarity progressing over the earth -- an image of advancing awareness. The thirty-sixth hexagram is the inverse of this -- it shows the trigram of Clarity swallowed up by the earth. If the image of Advance of Consciousness symbolizes noon, when the sun is at the midheaven, then Clouded Perception symbolizes midnight, when the sun is at the Imum Coeli, or undersky. It is a time of maximum darkness, maximum ignorance; a time when the dark forces of the unconscious are at their strongest. We are reminded of the Dark Night of the Soul, an inescapable and inevitable phase of the Work: \n\n\n When, at length, they have practiced themselves for some time in the journey of virtue, persevering in meditation and prayer, wherein, with the suavity and relish they have found, they have become detached from worldly things, and acquired some spiritual strength in God, so as to be able to curb the creature appetites and in some small degree suffer for God some slight load and dryness, without turning back at the crucial moment; when, to their thinking, they are proceeding in these spiritual exercises to their entire satisfaction and delight; and when the Sun of Divine favors seems to them to shine most radiantly upon them, God darkens all this light, and shuts the door and fountain of the sweet spiritual water, which they were wont to drink in God as often and as long as they chose ... and thus, he leaves them in darkness so profound that they know not whither to direct the sense of the imagination and speculations of the mind. \nSt. John of the Cross \n\n\n The Dark Night of the Soul is the universal experience of everyone who follows the way beyond the tried and true paths of the spiritual dilettante. It is an archetypal filter for determining the survival of the fittest in psychic evolution. For those who have entered this phase of the Work, it is good to remember that no one is given a test that they can't pass if they sincerely want to. \n The situation in line five of this hexagram means little to one who is unacquainted with Chinese history. In its essence, the story of Count Chi concerns a superior man who was imprisoned by an evil emperor. The only way that he could survive this dark time was to feign insanity. Thus the message in the Image counsels us to show our intelligence by concealing it. There is a wide range of applications for this rule, and perhaps Lao Tse gives us the best paraphrase of the idea in his famous aphorism: He who knows does not speak; He who speaks does not know. \n In terms of the Work this can mean that one must firmly understand that there are some things which cannot be shared with just anyone. Inner work is very fragile until it has had time to crystallize, and to expose its truths to the harsh light of unsophisticated intellect is to risk severe damage to the process of individuation. \n\n\n One must not tell people of things they cannot grasp. There are mysteries that cannot be shared with everybody ... Some things can be told to no one and a secret told to a wrong person is destructive and even irresponsible. \nM.L. Von Franz -- The Feminine in Fairytales\n\n\n This hexagram can symbolize many situations, but sometimes it is a suggestion that you are ignorant or \"in the dark\" about the true state of affairs now prevailing.",

Blofeld: It is the duty of the Superior Man to go without food for three days if his activities require this of him. Ritsema/Karcher: A chun tzu tending-towards moving: righteously not taking-in indeed. Cleary (2): It is right that they do not eat. [This is like a just person fleeing a vicious tyrant \u2026 such is the speed of travel that they do not have the leisure to eat for three days.]Wu: For righteousness sake, he refuses to eat.] \n Legge:  Line one is dynamic, and in its right place. He should be going forward, but the general signification of the hexagram supposes him to be wounded. The wound, received at the commencement of the action, is but slight. It suggests a bird hurt so that it must droop its wings. The subject then appears directly as the superior man. He understands that he must desist from the struggle for a time, and is so rapt in the thought that he can fast for three days and not think of it. When he does withdraw, opposition may follow him, but he holds to his own purpose. The commentary says that he does not purposely fast, but when he has nothing to eat he doesn't complain. He thinks it right that it should be so in this case.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man encounters hostility and derision in his attempt to soar above all obstacles. He does not compromise but perseveres in his thinking and remains true to his principles. People do not understand him. \n Wing:  An attempt to rise above the obstacles in your environment will be met with hostility. If you decide to serve your personal drives and compromise the needs of society, you will be misunderstood and censured. Such is the difficulty of the position. \n Editor:  Flying: Air is the realm of thought. To fly is to move in the realm of ideas: to think, speculate, reason. Drooping wings: Wounded in the realm of thought: impaired thinking, inferior conceptualization, crippled by faulty ideas or incomplete information, \u201cclipped wings.\u201d He does not eat: he doesn't jump to conclusions, but reasons it out to the end. Three days: A period of completion. (\"The Chinese say that numbers begin at one and are made perfect at three.\" -- Gaskell, Dictionary of Scriptures and Myths.) People speak derisively: Subordinate elements within the psyche (emotions, etc.) clamor for resolution, easy answers, etc. Psychologically, this combination of symbols points to a confused situation which demands careful differentiation. Though answers may not be forthcoming immediately, be patient and you will get what you seek. The line can also refer to painfully following one's path regardless of consequences. (Compare with symbolism of fourth line correlate.) \n\n\n In a word: the first work of the hero is to retreat from the world scene of secondary effects to those causal zones of the psyche where the difficulties really reside, and there to clarify the difficulties, eradicate them in his own case (i.e., give battle to the nursery demons of his local culture) and break through to the undistorted direct experience and assimilation of what C.G. Jung has called \"the archetypal images.\" This is the process known to Hindu and Buddhist philosophy as viveka, \"discrimination.\" \nJoseph Campbell --The Hero with a Thousand Faces \n\n A. Your thinking is confused and requires a new point of view. Don't jump to easy conclusions. Even though you are anxious to resolve the issue, you are obliged to reason it through to the end."

Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune comes from [the line's] devotion to the rule.  Blofeld: This good fortune results from compliance with laws and regulations.

The \"proper fashion of acting\" is suggested by the magnetic line being the central place.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man is injured but is not disabled. He recovers and pursues his good purpose with the strength of a horse. \n Wing:  Rather than disabling you, a recent injury that you have sustained on your path will serve to inspire you toward affirmative and vigorous action in the direction of the general good. \n Editor: The thigh is a walking muscle, giving us the power to move or act. The left is a universal symbol of the unconscious psyche and its functions. The left thigh, then, is an image of unconscious motive power, or natural motivation. To be \"wounded in the left thigh\" suggests an impeded natural response, as opposed to a conscious, willed response. (When associated with the idea of Clouded Perception, this may refer to a failure of insight or intuition.) A horse represents energy in general; here it may be psychic energy relating to perception -- \"horse- sense,\" if you will. One is reminded of the centaur Chiron, the \u201cwounded healer\u201d of Greek myth, who was also wounded in the thigh. In astrology, Chiron symbolizes unhealable wounds, and although it may be stretching the symbolism here, dealing with such wounds is a natural part of the Work: they may be unhealable, but they must be dealt with nonetheless. In the words of an old Blues lyric: \u201cI may get better, but I won\u2019t get well.\u201d Sometimes receiving this line is a hint that if you were in touch with your inner processes you wouldn't have needed to ask the question. \n\n\n Fusion, inner unity, is obtained by means of \"friction,\" by the struggle between \"yes\" and \"no\" in man. If a man lives without inner struggle, if everything happens to him without opposition, if he goes wherever he is drawn or wherever the wind blows, he will remain such as he is. But if a struggle begins in him, and particularly if there is a definite line in this struggle, then, gradually, permanent traits begin to form themselves, he begins to \"crystallize.\" \nGurdjieff \n\n A. Crippled by ignorance, but saved by instinct -- let horse-sense be your guide. \n B. A lack of awareness has crippled your ability to respond, but the impetus of your innate sense of what is correct will carry you through."

But even this light is turned into thick darkness, when any particle of light from heaven flows in there. \nSwedenborg -- Heaven and Hell \n\n A. You had clarity, then you lost it. \n B. An image of the source of darkness, ignorance or negativity in the situation at hand. \n C. A negative element about to be eliminated. \n\n February 12, 2001, 12/09/08"

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Harmony  shows the union of heaven and earth, and all things consequently united -- high and low, superior and inferior are all in accord. The lower trigram is made up of dynamic lines, and the upper of magnetic lines: strength is within, devotion is without; the superior man is inside and increasing, the inferior man is outside and decreasing.",
        "Legge": "The Judgment refers to the structure of the hexagram, with the three dynamic lines below, and the three magnetic lines above. The former are \"the great,\" active and vigorous; the latter are \"the inferior,\" passive and yielding. In many editions of theI Chingbeneath the hexagram of Harmonythere appears hexagram number fifty-four,Propriety, which becomes Harmonyif the third and fourth lines exchange places. A situation in which the motive forces are represented by three dynamic, and the opposing by three magnetic lines, must be progressive and successful.Harmonyis called the hexagram of the first month of the natural spring, when for six months the forces of growth are in ascendance.\n Canon McClatchie translates: \"The Image means that heaven and earth have now conjugal intercourse with each other, and the upper and lower classes unite together.\"\n Ch'eng-tzu says on the Image that a ruler should frame his laws to operate like the seasons, so that the people exist within the structure of a natural rather than an arbitrary order."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Harmony depicts the waning of egotistical illusions and the waxing of true potential.\n The Superior Man allows his inner virtue to rule the psyche.\n Without changing lines, Harmony suggests a fruitful union of opposites and consequent state of balance in the matter at hand.\n Wilhelm translates the opening phrase of the Confucian commentary as: \"Heaven and earth unite.\" Blofeld renders it: \"The celestial and terrestrial forces have intercourse and all things are in communion with one another.\" Legge has already called attention to McClatchie's version of: \"Heaven and earth have now conjugal intercourse with each other.\" \n This image is one of the most universal symbols produced by the human psyche: the sexual union of Spirit and Matter (heaven and earth). This is the hieros gamos or holy marriage of alchemy, the union of Shiva and Shakti in Hinduism, the conjoined male and female deities in tantric Buddhism, the syzygies of Gnosticism and the union of heaven and earth in the Kabbalah.\n\n\n The notions of the couple and the sacred marriage held a very important place in ancient Chinese religious thinking. Every sacred power was twofold, male and female; but since only one half of the sacred couple was generally enclosed in any one sanctuary, the ritual was directed at reconstituting the whole... The complete being is male and female; since most men neglect or repress their feminine nature, they are out of balance; their male aggressiveness comes to the fore, and their whole vitality suffers. There can be no true Holiness without a prior revitalization of femininity. \nM. Kaltenmark --Lao Tzu and Taoism\n\n\n Psychologically, the condition pictured by this hexagram is a metaphor for a high state of integration within the psyche. Here it is described in alchemical and Jungian terminology:\n\n\n The hermetic vessel is oneself. In it the many pieces of psychic stuff scattered throughout one's world must be collected and fused into one, so making a new creation. In it must occur the union of the opposites called by the alchemists the coniunctio or marriage... (This union), in psychological terms corresponds to man with his feminine soul, the anima, or to a woman with her masculine counterpart, the animus -- the union in each case constituting the inner marriage, the hieros gamos by which the individual must become whole.\n M.E. Harding --Psychic Energy\n\n\n To receive this hexagram does not necessarily mean that one has attained such a high integration, but it might indicate a step in that direction. The ultimate hieros gamos only occurs after all of the scattered and mismatched forces within the psyche have been brought together in correct alignment -- in I Ching terms, when all of the lines are in their proper places with proper correlates as imaged in hexagram number 63, Completion. Until this final union there are innumerable \"lesser\" conjunctions which must first take place -- a fact recognized in tantric yoga:\n\n\n The final goal of the tantricist is to reunite the two contrary principles -- Shiva and Shakti -- in his own body. When Shakti, who sleeps, in the shape of a serpent, at the base of his body, is awoken by certain yogic techniques, she moves through a medial channel by way of the chakras up to the top of the skull, where Shiva dwells, and unites with him. The union of the divine pair within his own body transforms the yogin into a kind of \"androgyne.\" But it must be stressed that \"androgynization\" is only one aspect of a total process, that of the reunion of the opposites. Actually, Tantric literature speaks of a great number of \"opposing pairs\" that have to be reunited. \nMircea Eliade -- Myths, Rites, Symbols\n\n\n The establishment of the \" Kingdom of Heaven on Earth\" is yet another metaphor for this process of psychic unification. Here is the Kabbalistic version:\n\n\n It is by the establishment of the celestial on the terrestrial, or of heaven upon earth, that the house of the King (humanity) will become united and the King will rejoice thereat, for then the two kingdoms will become one and then the new and living way will become opened to those who make themselves susceptible and receptive of the Higher and Diviner life... When these two worlds become united and blended together they are symbolized by the union of the male and female, the one being the complement of the other. \nThe Zohar \n\n\n\u00a0 \n SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION\n Legge points out that many editions of the I Chingassociate hexagram number fifty-four,Propriety, with this figure. What do the changing third and fourth lines ofPropriety imply about the role of the ego in the Work? The traditional name forPropriety is \"The Marrying Maiden\" -- how does that relate to the concept of the holy marriage in Harmony? Compare the Judgments and Images of the two hexagrams and the role of the superior man in each. Note also the lesson implied when lines two and five in Harmony unite to make hexagram number sixty-three, Completion.",

Cleary (2): Means focusing the will beyond. Wu: Because the aspiration is to go upward.\n Legge:  The symbolism of the first line is suggested by the three dynamic lines of the lower trigram, all together, and all possessed by the same instinct to advance. The movement of the first line will be supported by the others, and will be fortunate. \"He has his will set on what is external to himself\" means that he is bent on going forward.",

You will attract others and find co- operation among those who have goals similar to your own.\n Editor:  This line changes the hexagram to number forty-six, Pushing Upward, another image of growth with a corresponding line which further reinforces the idea of upward progress: \"Advancing upward with the welcome of those above him...\" \"Grass roots\" are a foundation, source or essence, as in \u201cgrass roots support\u201d in a political campaign. To \"uproot\" is to remove from a fixed or entrenched position. \"Other stalks\" are analogous elements -- \"fellow travelers.\" The image suggests the positive alteration of a heretofore static situation.\n\n\n When the shadow has been made conscious and has been accepted as part of the personality, its contents and part of its energies are added to those of the ego, so that a further development of the I results. Similarly, when the anima or animus has been united to the conscious psyche by a process described in many religious systems as an inner marriage, a further enlargement of consciousness results, and the conscious personality begins to display those qualities of dignity and stability which are the marks of the unique or individuated personality. \nM.E.

You now have a responsibility to undertake difficult tasks, to be tolerant of all people, and to maintain far-reaching visions. Avoid getting involved in current factions and special-interest groups.\n Editor:  Wilhelm/Baynes translate \"no selfish friendships\" as: \"not regarding one's companions.\" The idea is that correct behavior takes precedence over popular opinion. Thoreau's famous line: \"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer,\" is an analogous idea. The discipline of the Work immediately places one in this category. A complete understanding of this line depends upon what is said in line five, which see.\n\n\n From my point of view, he can be called a remarkable man who stands out from those around him by the resourcefulness of his mind, and who knows how to be restrained in the manifestations which proceed from his nature, at the same time conducting himself justly and tolerantly towards the weaknesses of others. \nGurdjieff\n\n A.

Wu: Is a condition prevailing between heaven and earth.\n Legge: The symbolism of the third line shows the constant change that is taking place in nature and human affairs. As night becomes day, and winter becomes summer, so calamity may be expected to follow prosperity, and decay the flourishing of a state. The third is the last line in the lower trigram of Strength, by whose creative activity the happy state of Harmony has been produced.

Wu: He is destined to remain empty \u2026 Because his willingness to share comes from his heart.\n Legge:  The subjects of the fourth and other yin lines of the upper trigram are not to be seen as opponents of the yang lines in the lower trigram, but as their correlates.

Pay no thought to ultimate rewards but maintain a steady course toward your aim. Use the help of others, if offered.\n Editor:  None of the translations of this line say quite the same thing, yet the meaning is clear enough when interpreted in relation to the symbolism of the figure as a whole. This is the first magnetic line of the hexagram, and the message is stated in terms of a female sexual response. She doesn't rely upon her \"rich resources\" -- she doesn't use her magnetic power aggressively, but willingly surrenders to dynamic initiative. Psychologically this means that Eros defers to Logos, emotion to reason, ego to Self, or whatever the situation at hand suggests is a proper subordination of one principle to another.\n\n\n In every exposition of the Perennial Philosophy the human soul is regarded as feminine in relation to the Godhead, the personal God and even the Order of Nature. Hubris, which is the original sin, consists in regarding the personal ego as self-sufficiently masculine in relation to the Spirit within and to Nature without, and in behaving accordingly. \nAldous Huxley\n\n A.

Humility and modesty will allow you to communicate with the sentiments of your followers in mind.

In the situation symbolized here, the magnetic fifth line yields her authority to the dynamic second line -- each is out of its \"correct\" place, and so they swap positions, so to speak. The meaning is that yin willingly defers to yang, female yields to male, emotions to intellect, feelings to principle, etc. It is significant to note that in a hexagram depicting a holy marriage, the perfect union of Heaven and Earth, that the only line mentioning marriage is this one. The marriage is between lines two and five, and when they both change the hexagram created is number 63, After Completion, the \"perfect\" or reference hexagram determining all correct relationships."

Instead, devote your time to strengthening your ties with those close to you.\n Editor: A walled city is a concentration of similar elements in one place. Within its walls dwell all of the factors which go to make up whatever it is that the city represents-- perhaps an attitude or belief. For example: suppose I believe that the world is flat. All of the thoughts, feelings, attitudes and emotions which contribute to this belief live in \"the city.\" If I have an experience which strongly challenges my belief--say, a photograph taken of the earth from outer space which definitely proves that my belief in a flat earth is incorrect--then one could say that the \"walls of my city have collapsed.\" Now I could fight this and say that obviously the outer space photograph is a fake--I could try to maintain my belief regardless of all the evidence to the contrary. However, the realistic response to the situation would not be to \"use the army\" (defend the indefensible), but to just let the dust settle--inform the people in the city (the now outmoded thoughts and feelings) that the situation has changed and that the best response is to sit tight and see what emerges from the rubble.\n\n\n A community's conviction system is its castle, a walled city to protect it against alternative interpretations of the great and unknown reality in the midst of which it must somehow live.\nB. Bruteau --The Psychic Grid \n\n A. A distinction is dissolved, a belief is shattered. Don't fight it -- let it be. Change is in process and confusion prevails -- control your emotions and maintain order within the psyche. Despite turmoil, take no action -- allow the transformation to complete itself.\n\n May 26, 2001, 4/23/06"

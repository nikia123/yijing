    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Great Powerwe see that which is great becoming strong. The trigram of Strength directs the trigram of Movement, and hence the whole is expressive of vigor. But that which is great necessitates firm correctness. The attributes of heaven and earth are displayed when firmness and correctness attain their ideal state.",
        "Legge": "Because the dynamic lines predominate in Great Power,the figure suggests a state in which there is an abundance of strength and vigor. Is strength alone enough for the conduct of affairs? Of course not! Strength must always be subordinated to the idea of right, and exerted only in harmony with it. \n The lower trigram symbolizes Strength, the upper symbolizes Movement. In the Confucian commentary, \"that which is great\u201d denotes the group of four dynamic lines which strikes us on looking at the figure, and also the superior men in positions of power, of whom these are the representatives. That the attributes of heaven and earth are displayed means that the power of men should be a reflection of the great power which we see impartially working in nature. \n Ch'eng-tzu says on the Image: \"Thunder rolling in the sky and making all things shake is the symbol of Great Power.\"  In relating its application to man, he quotes a beautiful saying of antiquity: \"The strong man is he who overcomes himself.\""
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Control yourself. \n The Superior Man does nothing that is not in accordance with the principles of the Work. \n Wilhelm and Blofeld translate this hexagram as The Power of the Great., but I prefer Liu's rendition of Great Power, because it has a more neutral connotation. The Power of the Great suggests the might of kings and emperors, and implies \"superior\" power wielded at one's own discretion. It is too easy to misinterpret this hexagram as a clear injunction to take unilateral action. Such is seldom the case -- the hexagram depicts a charge of latent energy which must be properly managed. \n The figure is usually compared with the image of a ram or goat -- the four lower dynamic lines being the body, and the two upper magnetic lines representing the horns. Since this hexagram is the preceding figure of Retreat turned upside down, one can imagine the two together as a person retreating across a pasture pursued by a charging beast. The ram/goat is mentioned in four of the six lines of the hexagram. This is certainlyGreat Power, but in such a crude form it cannot be truthfully called The Power of the Great.\n Truly Great Power, as the Judgment tells us, is derived from our will to restrain our emotions, instincts and appetites. Note that lines two and four are the most positively forceful lines in the hexagram and that both imply restraint of power as the proper way to attain one's goals. Without changing lines, the hexagram sometimes refers to provocations in which one is \"legitimately\u201d tempted to a self-righteous display of \"power.\u201d Remember that other people's ego-trips are none of your concern: the superior man does not respond to them with other than dignified reserve. Regard it as a test and be joyful if you pass it! \n\n\n Everything found in later literature seems to indicate that these meditative schools required a strong discipline and faithful adherence to a strict regimen. The schools were extremely demanding, and were open only to those willing to devote themselves totally. Before even being admitted to one of these ancient meditative schools, a person had to be not only spiritually advanced but in complete control of all his emotions and feelings. Beyond that, the disciplines of the Torah and commandments were central to these schools, and these disciplines required a degree of self-mastery to which not everyone could aspire. \nAryeh Kaplan -- Jewish Meditation",

Wu: Confidence has been misplaced. \n Legge:  This line is dynamic, in its correct place, and is the first line of the lower trigram of Strength in the hexagram of Great Power.

You must not force this issue because you are not in a position to do so successfully. \n Editor:  Compare this line with the definition of compulsion: \n Compulsion:1a. an act of compelling: a driving by force, power, pressure, or necessity. 2. an irresistible impulse to perform an irrational act. \n The power is in the toes, the lowest part of the body, and the very bottom of the hexagram. This suggests a compulsive, unconscious drive, or an ill-considered impulse to act. If it is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number thirty-two, Consistency,Duration or Standing Fast, which is the implied proper response here.

It is no longer necessary to prove anything.

We need to allow ourself to be led, not setting up structured ideas of how things must happen. We should give up anger and feelings of retribution.

When that happens, beware: the statement can have a maddeningly koan-like range of meanings. In the positive sense, because line five occupies the central place there is the possibility that one understands the Mean and knows when to refrain from action: one \"loses the goat (impetus to act) with ease.\" Alternately, the Blofeld, Liu and Ritsema/Karcher versions depict power which is misused or wasted. As a weak line in a strong place in a hexagram of strength and action, this can also refer to an impotent force with little power to affect the situation at hand. Since \"no remorse\" is involved, apparently no harm accrues. \n\n\n Strength may be good or it may be evil. The same is true of weakness. The ideal is the Mean. \nChou Tun-I \n\n A. You can easily discard your compulsion to act. \n B. An inferior force is eliminated from the situation. \n C. Moderation prevents an excessive response. \n D.

This means nothing less than that the conflict with all its excruciating implications must be endured consciously; we cannot seek to terminate it forcibly by taking sides, by enforcing a premature decision. Symbolically this amounts to a crucifixion; by our consent, our acceptance of this suffering, we are nailed to the cross of the opposing drives. We keep the apparent evil in full sight and continue to wait for a way that allows us to express its energy in constructive rather than destructive ways, though this may seem impossible at the moment, both in terms of morality and of existing reality. \nE.C.

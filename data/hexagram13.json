    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Union of Forces the magnetic line has the central place of influence and responds to her correlate line in the upper trigram of Strength. The hexagram takes its name from the upper trigram of Strength lending its power to the lower trigram of Clarity and Intelligence. This represents the correct course of the superior man. It is only the superior man who can comprehend and affect the minds of all under the sky.",
        "Legge": "Union of Forces describes a condition which is the opposite of the preceding hexagram of Divorcement. What was there distress and obstruction is here a union of forces. But it must be based entirely on the good of the whole, without any taint of selfishness.\n The dynamic line correctly in the fifth place occupies the most important position, and has for his correlate the magnetic second line, also in her correct place. The one female line is naturally sought after by all the male lines. The editors of the K'ang-hsi edition would make the second line respond to all of the lines of the upper trigram, as being more agreeable to the idea of union.\n The upper trigram is that of Heaven, the lower is of Fire, whose tendency is to mount upwards. This image suggests the fire ascending, blazing to the sky and uniting with it. All these ideas are in harmony with the notion of union, but it must be free of all factionalism, and this is indicated by its being in the remote districts of the country, where people are unsophisticated and free from the corrupting effects of urban intrigue. Although a union from such motives can cope with the greatest difficulties, yet a word of caution is added."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Connections are being made. If you are able to maintain your will, it is advisable to push for a synthesis .\n The Superior Man differentiates and prioritizes; he sorts and evaluates his options.\n This is another image of union -- not the supreme union of hexagram number eleven, Harmony, but a subordinate union of forces within the psyche which builds toward an eventual grand alliance. The component trigrams show the union of Strength and Clarity, suggesting that a certain level of mental comprehension is involved. To receive the hexagram without changing lines is often a confirmation of your particular thought -- saying, in effect: \"You've made the connection.\"\n Comprehension (synthesis) involves making distinctions (analysis) -- a paradoxical process in which one must divide before one can (re)unite. (This is the solve et coagula of alchemy.) Thus we see the superior man in the Image creating categories to bring about union -- this is discrimination directed toward reclassification or rectification. For example, a heterogeneous mixture of vegetable and flower seeds is made meaningful when one sorts them into their separate categories. The disparate elements then become coherently \"united\" -- in I Chingterms, each line obtains its proper correlate as in Hexagram number 63.\n\n\n (Dialectic) alternates between synthesis and analysis until it has gone through the entire domain of the intelligible and has arrived at the principle. Stopping there, for it is only there that it can stop, no longer busying itself with a multitude of objects since it has arrived at unity, it contemplates. \nPlotinus -- The Enneads\n\n\n The Chinese name of this hexagram includes the word Jen, which is apparently a difficult concept, since many philosophers have spent a good deal of energy in trying to define it:\n\n\n Jen has been variously translated as benevolence, perfect virtue, goodness, human-heartedness, love, altruism, etc. None of these expresses all the meanings of the term. It means a particular virtue, benevolence, and also the general virtue, the basis of all goodness. ...Neo-Confucianists interpreted it as impartiality, the character of production and reproduction, consciousness, seeds that generate, the will to grow, one who forms one body with Heaven and Earth, or \"the character of love and the principle of mind.\" In modern times, it has even been equated with ether and electricity... \nWing-Tsit Chan -- A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy\n\n\n Chu Hsi defines Jen as the \"character of the mind\" (psyche) and \"the principle of love\" (union). Interpreted in this way we are enabled to apprehend the essence of the word \"love,\" which is union -- becoming one with its object. I have chosen the title of Union of Forces to emphasize intra-psychic dynamics which are not immediately obvious in Wilhelm's title of Fellowship with Men. For example in dealing with questions pertaining to the Work, the concept of \"ego states\" or \"subpersonalities\" is often relevant to the symbolism of this hexagram:\n\n\n The human self has been described here as composed of different ego states separated by boundaries. It has been likened to the structure of political principalities. From clinical observation we find that ego states can cooperate for mutual well-being, like allied nations against a common enemy. An ego state may become split, like East and West Germany, or fracture into many segments, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ego states may become cognitively dissonant and hostile to each other, like Syria and Israel. In fact, the behavior of ego states within an individual is not unlike that between individuals, and between those groups of individuals called countries. Why should the behavior of human \"stuff\" not be substantially similar at all levels of its organizations? ...The evidence of self division into ego states is significant, and an equally tenable hypothesis might be that the states and boundaries of political entities have been imposed by men on each other because these represent an externalization of the internal divisions in their own selves. \nJ.G. Watkins -- The Therapeutic Self\n\n\n This hexagram's \"shadow side\" reveals circumstances preventing the union of entities or forces, more than those conditions promoting fruitful affiliation. Note that only the first and fifth lines of the figure depict a positive synthesis; the first one is minor, and in the case of line 5, union is attained only after much struggle. Line 2 reveals a clique or faction situation opposed to the general welfare, and lines 3 and 4 are images of recalcitrant forces unable to either join or attack the alliance. The sixth line depicts a partial union (probably the most common outcome in general experience), which the Confucian commentary nevertheless minimizes. Out of six lines then, only two describe anything like complete fellowship. I have received this hexagram without changing lines when the context of the question revealed an \u201cincestuous,\u201d clique-type situation, so not all \"fellowship\" or Union of Forcesis necessarily an ideal configuration.",

Psychologically, the image can suggest the beginning of a new cycle or dialectical process within the psyche.\n\n\n In the beginning stages people can commit the most horrible sins of unconsciousness and stupidity without having to pay much for it. Nature does not take its revenge. But when the work progresses over the years, even a slight deviation, a hint of the wrong word, or fleeting wrong thought, can have the worst psychosomatic consequences. It is as though it became ever more subtle, moving on the razor's edge. Any faux pas is an abysmal catastrophe, while previously one could tramp kilometers off the path without one's own unconscious giving one a slap or taking its revenge in some way. \nM.L.

Wu: This is a way to humiliation.\n Legge: Lines two and five are proper correlates, a fact which in this instance suggests the idea of a partial and limited union.

        "Notes": "Siu:  Because of special privileges and factions, only a limited fellowship is realized. Regrets and problems result.\n Wing: There is a tendency toward elitism and exclusivity. This creates limitations for everyone in society. Such a situation of egotism and selfish interests will bring regret.\n Editor:  The image is one of incestuous exclusivity. The formation of factions, special interest groups and cliques can only cause harm to the larger psyche or to society because it excludes the vital give and take necessary for evolution and eventual synthesis. Sometimes the line can suggest the idea of being caught in a closed loop or vicious circle -- energy is trapped by limiting beliefs, thus preventing growth into new realms of being.\n\n\n When a soul remains for long in this withdrawal and estrangement from the whole, with never a glance towards the intelligible, it becomes a thing fragmented, isolated, and weak. Activity lacks concentration. Attention is tied to particulars.

Wu: He should be contented with his lot.\n Legge:  Line three is dynamic in a dynamic place, but without a proper correlate in line six.

        "Notes": "Siu:  Mistrust ensues. The man conceals his weapons, plans an ambush, but does not come forth.\n Wing:  There is a possibility that those involved in the situation have selfish interests and divergent goals. This is unfortunate, because the ensuing mistrust of each for the other will grind events to a halt. Unless goals are realigned, no progress can be made and nothing will come of the situation.\n Editor:  Wilhelm remarks here that the situation depicts mistrust -- union is blocked by some divisive element such as doubt or cynicism. Perhaps a pessimistic attitude is impeding the flow of events. Although the line is not necessarily always completely negative (note the lack of an appended value judgment), the image depicts latent forces of an inferior sort blocking the natural flow of energy or growth. If this is the only changing line we receive hexagram number 25, Innocence, with a corresponding line depicting undeserved misfortune. Psychologically interpreted, unconscious complexes could threaten the Work by refusing to integrate. It is possible that this transcends the ego's conscious awareness. Blofeld's note does not agree with the general sense of the line, and may be considered anomalous.\n\n\n Unfortunately repression does not eliminate the qualities or drives or keep them from functioning. It merely removes them from ego awareness; they continue as complexes. By being removed from view they are also removed from supervision and can thereby continue their existence unchecked and in a disruptive way. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest\n\n A.

Reconciliation is imminent.\n Wing:  Your obsession with the attainment of your personal goals will ultimately cut you off from others. The more you pursue your dream, the farther you drift from your Community. In time, your loneliness will bring you to your senses. Good fortune.\n Editor: Psychologically interpreted, a city can symbolize a focus of energy (perhaps a belief-complex), within which its components live in \"fellowship.\" The city walls represent the boundaries defining this belief system. Seen from the outside, the wall is the separation between one condition and another; seen from the inside it provides both definition and sanctuary for its inhabitants. (Regarded this way, the differences between lines three and four can be seen as the differences between the repression and sublimation of a complex.) At any rate, this line depicts a favorable impasse or restraint of power in the situation at hand.\n\n\n Even though we are not responsible for the way we are and feel, we have to take responsibility for the way we act. Therefore we have to learn to discipline ourselves. And discipline rests on the ability to act in a manner that is contrary to our feelings when necessary.

The Work still has a long way to go to be complete, but since that seldom happens this side of hyperspace, any increment of integration has to be better than no progress at all.

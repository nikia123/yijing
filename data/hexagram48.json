        "Legge": "Although a town site may be altered, The Well remains the same. Its water level neither disappears nor receives any great increase, and the people can draw from it freely. Misfortune ensues if the rope breaks or the bucket is broken before it reaches the water.",
        "Wilhelm/Baynes": "The Well. The town may be changed, but the well cannot be changed. It neither decreases nor increases. They come and go and draw from the well. If one gets down almost to the water and the rope does not go all the way, or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.",
        "Blofeld": "A Well. A city may be moved, but not a well. [The building of a city depends upon ourselves; but wells cannot be moved to places where nature supplies no water. The implication is that our activities are limited by natural conditions.] A well suffers from no decrease and no increase; but often, when the people come to draw water there, the rope is too short or the pitcher gets broken before reaching the water -- misfortune! [What we desire is there for the taking, but we may not succeed in getting it.]",
        "Liu": "The Well. The city might be moved; but not the well. It neither overflows nor runs dry. People come and go, drawing from the well. The rope nearly reaches the water, but not quite; the jug breaks -- misfortune.",
        "Ritsema/Karcher": "The Well: amending the capital, not amending the Well. Without losing, without acquiring. Going, coming: Welling, Welling. Muddy culmination: truly not-yet the well- rope Well. Ruining one's pitcher: Pitfall. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of the life water coming from the depths that everyone may draw on. It emphasizes that maintaining access to this central source is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to go to the well!]",
        "Shaughnessy": "The Well:  Changing the city but not changing the well; there is no loss, there is no gain. Going and coming so orderly; when the drying up arrives one also has not yet drawn from the well; burdening its formed earthenware jug; inauspicious.",
        "Cleary (1)": "The Well",
        "Cleary (2)": "\u2026 People come and go, but the well remains a well. Lowering the bucket to the water, if you overturn the bucket before drawing it up from the well, this is unlucky.",
        "Wu": "The Well indicates that the planning of a district may be changed, but the location of the well may not. The water level of a well will neither increase nor decrease from use. There are wells here and there. When one is drawing water from a well, if he tangles the rope and damages the bucket just before it clears the well, it will be foreboding."

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Wood penetrates the water and raises it, giving the image ofThe Wellwhich gives nourishment yet is not exhausted. The dynamic central lines in the second and fifth places indicate that the town site may change, but the well does not. If the rope does not reach the water the well does not serve its purpose. A broken bucket brings about evil.",
        "Legge": "The upper trigram represents Water, and the lower symbolizes Wood, giving the image of a wooden bucket in the water of a well. What is said on this hexagram might be styled: \"Lessons to be learned from a well for the proper government of a country.\" A well is to its users what a government is to its subjects, and if rulers would only apply the ancient precepts of government to the present circumstances, they and their people would benefit greatly. \n In the Judgment we see the well remaining substantially the same through many changes of society -- a dependable source of refreshment to its users. As the fashion of the well remains changeless, so do the principles of human nature and good government. The value of the well depends upon the water being drawn up and used -- and so must the principles of good government be implemented. \n Anthony: This hexagram usually indicates that we have a hidden doubt or fear. We may secretly disbelieve our path."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Amid the changes of life the only constant is the psyche itself -- to be alive is to draw upon its energy. The ego\u2019s challenge lies in the correct comprehension of its images. \n The Superior Man promotes the harmonious interplay of his thoughts and feelings. (Works on the integration of his complexes.) \n A well is a universal symbol of a source of inner truth, and is often associated with a place that is sacred to the gods: \n\n\n There he built an altar and invoked the name of Yahweh. There he pitched his tent, and there Isaac's servants sank a well. \nGenesis  26: 25 \n From the first well, which is of animal nature and deep, the father drinks, together with his children and cattle; from the second, which is yet deeper and on the very margin of nature, there drink only the children of men, namely those whose reason has awakened and whom we call philosophers; from the third, the deepest of all drink the sons of the All-Highest, whom we call gods and true theologians. \nCardinal Nicholas of Cusa \n\n\n Psychologically interpreted, a well symbolizes the continuously flowing unconscious psyche, the fountain of all awareness. In this hexagram each line represents a level within the well -- by extension suggesting a hierarchy of value in the unconscious. It is important to remember that not all of our inner images, intuitions or impulses come from the Self. Note that lines one through four all show the water of the well not being utilized for one reason or another -- only in lines three, five and six is it actually available for use. \n\n\n In some sensitive individuals there is an awakening of para-psychological perceptions. They have visions, which they believe to be of exalted beings; they may hear voices, or begin to write automatically, accepting the messages at their face value and obeying them unreservedly. The quality of such messages is very varied. Sometimes they contain fine teachings, but they should always be examined with much discrimination and sound judgment, and without being influenced by their uncommon origin or by any claim by their alleged transmitter. No validity should be attributed to messages containing definite orders and commanding blind obedience, and to those tending to exalt the personality of the recipient.\nRoberto Assagioli --Psychosynthesis\n\n\n The ego's point of view in relation to The Well is from the outside looking in \u2013 the insights emerge from beneath the surface of awareness and can be held in the light of consciousness only if one\u2019s comprehension is able to contain them. If \"the bucket breaks,\" our understanding is unequal to our observation and the insights are lost. (One might plausibly find the image for a cancer cure within one's psyche, but without a conscious frame of reference to acknowledge it, it would be unrecognized and lost.) Those who closely monitor their dreams know that there is an endless outpouring of strange images within the psyche which might be of inestimable value if only we knew what they referred to. \n Wilhelm emphasizes the idea of \"nourishing the people,\" which psychologically means that the role of the ego is to facilitate the cooperation of intra-psychic forces. \n\n\n The solution lies, rather, along the lines of a harmonious integration of all drives into the total personality, first through the proper subordination and coordination, and then through the transformation and sublimation of the excessive or unused quota of energy. \nRoberto Assagioli --Psychosynthesis",

Blofeld: The first clause signifies that our affairs take a downward trend; the second, that it is time to give up. Ritsema/Karcher: The below indeed. The season stowed-away indeed. Cleary (2): It is below. Because its time is gone. Wu: It has been abandoned. \n Legge: Line one is magnetic and at the bottom of the figure - suggesting the mud at the bottom of a well. Many men in authority are like such a well: corrupt, useless, unregarded. It is said of line one: \"Those who have a mind to do something in the world, when they look at this line and its symbolism will learn how they ought to exert themselves.\"",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man's life is immersed in corrupt, useless, and repulsive muck. No one is attracted to him. \n Wing: You rely too much upon your own opinions and perceptions and therefore have little to offer others in the way of insight or nourishment. When there is no longer an exchange with others, you are lost and forgotten. \n Editor: The Legge and Ritsema/Karcher translations are the only ones which mention \"birds\" or \"wildfowl\" here; the other translators use \"animals,\" \u201cgame,\u201d or \"creatures.\" I have often found the attribute of the bird to be useful in interpreting the psychological intent of this line. Birds symbolize the realm of intellect, ideas or thought, and often this line has clearly meant that my idea or concept of the matter at hand was stagnant or out-moded. For example, the notion that the world is flat is an idea which was once widely held, but which has since been \"forsaken in the course of time.\"  The image also suggests a very primitive level within the psyche which is best shunned by consciousness. \n\n\n In order to seize hold of the fantasies, I frequently imagined a steep descent. I even made several attempts to get to the very bottom. The first time I reached, as it were, a depth of about a thousand feet; the next time I found myself at the edge of a cosmic abyss ... I had the feeling that I was in the land of the dead. \nJung --Memories, Dreams, Reflections \n\n A. Image of an archaic, stagnant level of awareness or point of view. Obsolete thinking. \n B.

[Apparently the water table has changed, which prevents water from flowing into the well. Trying to draw water from it not only is unsuccessful, but also will damage the bucket. The little water may be enough for small fish, but it is not enough for people.]",
        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge: He has none cooperating with him above. Wilhelm/Baynes: He has no one to do it with him. Blofeld:  This is indicated by the failure of this line to win response from the other lines. Ritsema/Karcher: Without associating indeed. Cleary (2): It has no partner. Wu: It has nothing to offer. \n Legge: Line two is dynamic, and might very well symbolize an active spring which feeds the well, and through it, the ground and its cultivators. But it is in an inappropriate place, and has no proper correlate. Its cool waters cannot be brought to the top. \n Wilhelm/Baynes:  The water itself is clear, but it is not being used. Thus the well is a place where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes only to catch fish. But the jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be kept in it. This describes the situation of a person who possesses good qualities but neglects them. No one bothers about him. As a result he deteriorates in mind. He associates with inferior men and can no longer accomplish anything worthwhile.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  As in the case of able statesmen who refuse to serve as ministers of the government, the man possesses precious qualities but neglects them. His talents are dissipated in miscellaneous directions. \n Wing:  Because you may not be using your abilities and talents in a worthwhile way, you may go unnoticed in the world. When you are not sought out and challenged by your contemporaries, your talents will dissipate. When it becomes most important, you cannot fulfill your function. \n Anthony:  Doubt that we can achieve our goal through following the path causes good nourishment to be useless. \n Editor:  This line reiterates the ideas presented in the Judgment: \"If the drawing has nearly been accomplished, but before the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is broken, this is evil.\"  Psychologically, the image can suggest an insight or idea which is lost because it is not comprehended. \n\n\n In the training analysis the doctor must learn to know his own psyche and to take it seriously. If he cannot do that, the patient will not learn either. He will lose a portion of his psyche, just as the doctor has lost that portion of his psyche which he has not learned to understand. \nJung --Memories, Dreams, Reflections \n\n A.

Wilhelm/ Baynes: This is the sorrow of the active people. They beg that the king may be clear-minded, in order to attain good fortune. Blofeld: The first sentence implies activities which call forth pity; the second, that we should accept our good fortune. Ritsema/ Karcher: Moving: aching indeed. Seeking kingly brightness: acquiescing-in blessing indeed. Cleary (2): When the well is cleared but not drunk from, travelers are concerned; they seek enlightenment in the king to receive blessings.[Because it subdues the basic afflictions of the mind, the well is cleared, but because it does not yet realize essence, it is not drunk from. Here one should seek the aid of the buddhas; then one can help oneself and help others.] Wu: The people pray that the king may be perspicacious, such that they may all benefit from his reign. \n Legge:  Line three is dynamic and in its proper place -- it represents an able minister or officer.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man has competence which is being overlooked and unused. Were the chief executive clear-sighted, such a man would have been employed for the benefit of all. Those who know his abilities are deeply saddened to see them go to waste. \n Wing:  You may be overlooking an opportunity that has come your way or you, and your talents, may be overlooked by others. This is very unfortunate. If somehow this could be recognized, you and everyone around you would benefit. \n Anthony:  In spite of understanding things correctly, we cling to traditional defenses. The king, our inner self, is not clear-minded enough to trust and draw upon rich inner resources: to ask for help, to trust the unknown, to persevere in allowing ourself to be led docilely and receptively. Our path is trustworthy. \n Editor: Legge is unusually terse here. Since this is the only line in the lower trigram that is correctly positioned above its two incorrect companions, it suggests an asset which is ignored to the disadvantage of potential users. Perhaps an insight or connection within the psyche is going unrecognized by conscious awareness. The Well is very hierarchal in the progression of its lines, and it is instructive to compare it with hexagram number fifty, The Sacrificial Vessel, the third line of which has a similar meaning to this one. \n\n\n Here we confront a puzzling space-time transcendent dimension of a quasi-absolute knowledge from within, which is not, however, directly accessible to the rational ego. In dreams the unconscious dimension operates as if it encompassed unknown events outside of space and time (and to the dreamer often enough unknowable) and also subjective problems which lie ahead in the dreamer's development. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest \n\n A. An asset is ignored -- to the stress of those who might benefit from it. \n B. Unused power is wasted power. \n C. You don\u2019t see an advantage available to you."

This means that you will not be taking an active part in the affairs of others. By putting your life in order, however, you will be able to contribute more fully later on. \n Editor:  Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all translate this line in terms of an incomplete process: the well is undergoing reconstruction.

Psychologically, an inner transformation is taking place. \n\n\n While the hidden life forces are performing their mysterious work of transformation, the rational and willed attitude of the conscious ego can only interfere. It can neither assist nor guide. The libido is withdrawn from it, and it is left high and dry.

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Increase  shows the upper trigram brilliantly decreased to augment the lower. What descends from above reaches to all below, and the satisfaction of the people is without limit. Advantage in movement is shown in the blessings dispensed by the second and fifth lines from their correct positions. The action of Wood shows that it is advantageous to cross the great stream. Through the trigrams of Movement and Humility there is unlimited daily advancement -- heaven dispenses and earth produces, and all proceeds according to the requirements of the time.",
        "Legge": "Increase has the opposite meaning to hexagram number forty-one, Compensating Sacrifice [Decrease]. What king Wen had in mind was a ruler or a government operating to dispense benefits to the people and increase their resources. The two important lines in the figure are the correlates two and five. The general auspice of the hexagram is one of being successful in one's enterprises and of overcoming the greatest difficulties. \n The formation of the trigrams here is the reverse of that in the preceding hexagram. The people are full of pleasure in the labors of the ruler for their good. \"The action of Wood\" in the Confucian commentary refers to the upper trigram, which is the symbol of Wind and Wood. From wood boats are made on which the great stream may be crossed. In three hexagrams, this, fifty-nine and sixty-one, in which this is the upper trigram, we find mention made of crossing the great stream. In the Image thunder and wind are seen to increase one another, and their combination gives the idea of Increase."

    "Notes": "Judgment:  Take advantage of your opportunities. \n The Superior Man  recognizes his duty and rectifies his mistakes. Or: \"Accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative.\" \n If the ego's sacrifices for the good of the Work are described in the previous hexagram, here we see the inverse image of that figure in which it is the Self who bestows its blessings upon the psyche. The one implies the other -- in the words of an old Blues lyric: \"If you don't put somethin' in, you can't get nothin' out...\" The forty-first and forty-second hexagrams are intimately related, and in their interaction portray the active progress of the Work. To paraphrase the last sentence of the Confucian commentary: \"The Self dispenses and the ego produces, and all proceeds according to the requirements of the time.\" \n\n\n If a man continually weighs his actions and aims at the mean, he is in the highest of human ranks. In that way, he will come close to God and will attain what belongs to Him. This is the most perfect of the ways of worship. \nMaimonides -- Eight Chapters",

Great success will make his rashness irrelevant. The Confucian commentary says that \"one in a low position should not move in great affairs\" -- not a son, it is said, while his father is alive, nor a minister while his ruler governs, nor a member of an official department while its head directs its affairs.

Do not become rash or overly confident. \n Editor: If we reverse this hexagram it becomes number forty- one, Compensating Sacrifice,and this line (now \"upside down\") becomes line five of that figure, with a meaning nearly identical to this one. (See the commentary on 41:5 for the significance of the tortoise shells.) It is also interesting to note that in each case the changing line (either 42:2 or 41:5) changes its respective hexagram to number sixty-one, Inner Truth. Kuo Yung's mention of \"favorable spirits\" bringing increases to the recipient of this line is reminiscent of the legions of angels said to appear at the birth or inception of a new and positive force into spacetime: \n\n\n\n And suddenly with the angel there was a great throng of the heavenly host, praising God and singing: \"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace to men who enjoy his favor.\" \nLuke 2: 13-14 \n\n A.

When this happens it is a fair assumption that the original is ambiguous as well. My experience with the line prefers Wilhelm\u2019s version of line and commentary.

To \"observe no regular rule in the ordering of the heart\u201d suggests inconstancy and vacillation. Perhaps selfish motives have overwhelmed the ego's devotion to the Work. Selfishness is an imbalanced state where energy is appropriated by a part at the expense of the whole. Negative results are inevitable because the forces involved must seek equilibrium, and the stress of the imbalance is released in a violent reaction. \n\n\n Emotion is not an activity of the ego but, when uncontrolled, is something that happens to it. Affects occur usually where adaptation is weakest, and at the same time they reveal the reason for its weakness, namely a certain degree of inferiority and the existence of a lower level of personality. On this lower level with its uncontrolled or scarcely controlled emotions one behaves more or less like a primitive, who is not only the passive victim of his affects but also singularly incapable of moral judgment. \nJung -- Aion \n\n A.

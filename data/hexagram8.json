The laggards suffer disaster. [Just as the last hexagram deals ostensibly with military affairs, so does this one largely concern administration. For divination purposes, it should be regarded figuratively -- unless a problem of administration is actually involved in the enquiry.]",

        "Confucius/Legge": "Holding Together denotes help, and we see in the figure inferiors docilely following their superior. All that is said in the Judgment follows from the position of the dynamic line in the center of the upper trigram. Those who do not respond to him have exhausted their good fortune.",
        "Legge": "The idea of union between the different members and classes of a state and how it can be secured, is the subject of Holding Together. The dynamic line in the fifth place of authority represents the ruler to whom the subjects of all the other lines offer a ready submission. Generally, the second line is the proper correlate of the fifth, but here all of the other lines are also his subjects. Harmonious union is secured by the sovereign authority of the ruler, but he is warned to see that his virtue is worthy of his position, and his subjects are warned not to delay in submitting to him. Those who do not seek to promote and enjoy union until it is too late are left out in the cold. The sentiment is the same as that in the lines of Shakespeare about the tide in the affairs of men. In the Image, \"water upon the face of the earth\" suggests an emblem of close union."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  The success of the Work is determined by the proper integration of intrapsychic forces. Separated and disparate forces are an index of its failure. Unremitting willpower is the catalyst for unity. Do you have the requisite will to facilitate this goal? Ask the oracle.\n The Image: Archetypal intelligences (the gods) created many dimensions of awareness (Jung's collective unconscious or objective psyche), maintaining benevolent contact with them all. (\"Benevolent\" refers to original intent -- Plato's realm of ideal forms -- \"The Good.\" This is the image of an evolving multiverse of awareness \u2013 a human psyche.)\n Psychologically interpreted,Holding Together depicts the Self as the fifth-line ruler surrounded by its satellite complexes. Astrologically rendered, we see the same image in the solar system with its Sun surrounded by planets -- each symbolizing a faculty within the psyche (e.g., Mercury is intellect, Mars is aggression, etc). Viewed this way, the eighth hexagram portrays the functioning of a divine process. (Whenever the \"ancient kings\" are mentioned in the I Ching,we can take them as the symbolic architects of a primordial ideal of perfection.)\n The Image in Holding Together is an allegory of the Self establishing the various complexes within the psyche (the Sun establishing its planets) so that they can evolve into a reflection of the ideal intent of the Work. (In the timeless realms of hyperspace, the Garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem exist simultaneously, although here in spacetime, as key facilitators in a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d we labor somewhere between cause and effect.)\n Although the psyche of a functional human being is held together relatively coherently, its inner relationships are continuously orbiting each other in cycles of change. (Astrological transits symbolize such changes.) The Tao of psychic evolution (the Work) is to respond to the changes consciously and coherently so that all forces eventually become synchronized with the will of their source. The ego\u2019s sole responsibility is to do this in the spacetime dimension for the benefit of the Self.\n\n\n In whatever way one may conceive the relationship between the individual self and the universal Self, be they regarded as identical or similar, distinct or united, it is most important to recognize clearly, and to retain ever present in theory and practice, the difference that exists between the Self in its essential nature -- that which has been called the \u2018fount', the \u2018center', the \u2018deeper being', the \u2018apex' of ourselves -- and the small ordinary personality, the little \u2018self' or ego, of which we are normally conscious. The disregard of this vital distinction leads to absurd and dangerous consequences. \nRoberto Assagioli \u2013 Psychosynthesis\n\n\n The message for the superior man in this hexagram is the only injunction in the Book of Changesto re-consult the oracle. Implicit in this curious challenge is a need to evaluate your competence to further the Work. The answer should tell you the condition of your will.\n\n\n The will is, curiously, not recognized as the central and fundamental function of the ego. It has often been depreciated as being ineffective against the various drives and the power of the imagination, or it has been considered with suspicion as leading to self-assertion (will-to-power). But the latter is only a perverted use of the will, while the apparent futility of the will is due only to a faulty and unintelligent use. The will is ineffective only when it attempts to act in  oppositionto the imagination and to the other psychological functions, while its skillful and consequently successful use consists in regulating and directing all other functions toward a deliberately chosen and affirmed aim. \nRoberto Assagioli \u2013 Psychosynthesis\n\n\n The differences between hexagrams number seven and number eight are the differences between a geocentric and a heliocentric frame of reference \u2013 emphasizing the fact that the ego and the Self each perceive the psyche from an entirely different point of view.\n\n\n For my thoughts are not your thoughts, \n my ways not your ways -- it is Yahweh who speaks. \n Yes, the heavens are as high above earth \n as my ways are above your ways, \n my thoughts above your thoughts. \n Isaiah 55: 6-9",

Wu: There will be good fortune when others join to give support.\n Legge:  The earthenware vessel describes the plain, unadorned character of the sincerity called for. The other advantages are all the benefits that result from sincerity and union, which are themselves good.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man is filled with sincerity in his associations with others.

Unexpected good luck is indicated here.\n Editor:  Note the idea of humble containment -- one collects the disparate elements of the situation together in a plain clay bowl. Metaphorically, this suggests that the simplest, most elementary approach to the problem is the correct one. The line can refer to mental comprehension (\"holding together\"), involving basic principles, unvarnished truth, etc.\n\n\n Thus the individual psyche is an indefinite formation of unknown or largely unknown constitution and extent. If it is to be consolidated -- individuated, to use the technical term -- it is necessary first of all to determine its boundaries. Then all that belongs to the psyche must be brought within these boundaries. Finally, a center must be established that can control the functioning of the whole structure. \nM.E.

His convictions are deeply founded.\n Wing:  Trust your inner mind, maintain your integrity, and follow the demands of your convictions. You will be sought after by others. If you chase after the approval of others, you will lose your dignity.\n Editor:  Legge's commentary on the relationship between lines two and five portrays the ego-Self relationship. The Self is the dynamic ruler dwelling in a psychic dimension (\"the inward mind\"). The ego is always magnetic in relation to the Self, and ideally the servant of the Work in spacetime. The inward mind is thus the source of the voice of the Self. Because not every image or impulse in the psyche originates from the Self, Wilhelm's translation of the Confucian commentary (\"Do not lose yourself\"), warns us to be conscious enough to maintain connection with our authentic inner voice -- not some complex masquerading as such. (Often a tricky distinction.)\n\n\n Man too, in his inner being, has a plane of contact with the divine self. And that's why he can only find his own divine being within himself, never by directing his attention towards the outside world. \nElisabeth Haich -- Initiation\n\n A.

Avoid too intimate an association with the group while maintaining an outward sociability. Appearing committed to these people could darken your reputation later on.\n Anthony:  We hold with wrong elements in ourself such as an incorrect idea, or with emotions such as pride, anger or desire, which cause us to take hold of issues and become involved in an evil process. Or, through carelessness, we abandon the path to indulge in incorrect situations. Whenever we allow our inferiors to take over direction of our lives, we lose the help of the Sage. Getting this line either means that we are off the path, or that a situation will soon occur wherein we revert to a pattern of incorrect action, thereby losing the path.\n Editor: This is an unambiguous line. Applied to inner work, it can suggest that you have mistaken the prompting of an autonomous complex for the Self. (See Wilhelm's Confucian commentary on line two above.)

Discarding those who resist, accepting the devoted: this is the meaning of \"foregoes game that runs off in front.\" \"The citizens need no warning,\" for the one above makes them central. Blofeld: This good fortune is indicated by the central position of the ruling line. Leaving alone those difficult to catch and following where the chances seem good, the King nevertheless loses the game in front of him.

Wu:\u201cTo allow the game in front of him to escape\u201d means setting free those who want to leave and taking in those who want to come, etc.\n Legge:  As the ruler, line five is the center of union. The ancient rule for hunting expeditions was that after the beating was completed and the king was ready to commence taking game, one side of the enclosure into which it had been driven was left open and unguarded. This was proof of the royal benevolence which didn't want to make an end of all the creatures inside. So well known and understood was this benevolent principle, that all of his subjects cooperated in carrying it out. The union shown here is therefore characterized by mutual confidence and the appreciation of benevolent virtue.",

Union is based on mutual confidence and appreciation.\n Wing: You can trust fate at this time to bring you together with those who would further you. There is a natural attraction at work here. The atmosphere is liberal, and much can be accomplished. The time is auspicious, indeed. \n Editor:  This line is the subject of the Judgment and most of the commentary on the Judgment. It depicts a shake-down or refining process. In terms of the Work, because the ego has free will, it always has the option of \"escape.\" The Self allows it to choose, because free choice is essential to any permanent psychic integration. A coerced synthesis could hardly be expected to hold together for very long.

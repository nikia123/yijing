    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Enthusiasm shows one dynamic line inspiring responsive obedience in all the others: devoted obedience takes action. Such obedient action conforms to natural law and creates order and discipline in the people. The planets and the seasons follow their natural cycles. The sages similarly obey the laws of their nature and the people acknowledge their regulations and punishments as just.",
        "Legge": "Enthusiasm shows harmony and contentment throughout the kingdom -- a time when the people rejoice in their sovereign and readily obey him. At such a time his appointments and any military undertakings would be hailed and supported. Because he is close to the fifth place of dignity, the dynamic fourth line is seen as the chief executive officer of the ruler. The ruler has confidence in him, and all of the magnetic lines yield their obedience. Obedience is the attribute of the lower trigram which here takes the initiative and uses Movement, which is the attribute of the upper trigram.\n The symbolism of the Image is more obscure than usual. The use of music at sacrifices is supposed to assist in producing the union between God and his worshippers as well as the present and past generations."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Delegate authority and gather your forces.\n The Superior Man synchronizes his will with the intent of the Self via the principles of the Work.\nEnthusiasm is the reverse of the preceding hexagram of Temperance. In Temperance we saw the calm strength of a mountain concealed within the earth. In Enthusiasm we see thunder exploding out of the ground into the sky: the strength that was formerly tempered and restrained is now released. It is significant to note that while every line of Temperance is more or less \"favorable,\u201d every line of Enthusiasm is either negative or cautionary -- even the generally positive fourth line carries a hint of warning about \u201cdoubt.\u201d\n Negatively, Self-Deception (the passion of True Believers) seems to be what this hexagram is portraying. The figure often suggests a callow or deluded buoyancy -- the kind of outlook associated with romantic idealists. In its most negative aspect, Enthusiasm is Intemperance -- the exact opposite of the moderation and restraint shown in the preceding hexagram. The behavior of an untrained Great Dane puppy suddenly bursting into a formal dinner party could be described as \"enthusiasm,\u201d but hardly a desirable form thereof. The lower trigram of Obedient Devotion has suddenly employed the action and energy of the upper trigram of Thunderous Shock to express itself. This is inconsistent with the code of the superior man.\n Conversely, in its most positive sense, Enthusiasm suggests the surety of total self-confidence. Blofeld translates this as Repose, explaining that the name was suggested to him by his Chinese advisors. We begin to understand this subtle distinction when we compare the seemingly obscure connection with music in the Image with a passage from Chuang- tse: \n\n\n He who understands the music of heaven lives in accordance with nature in his life and takes part in the process of change of things in his death. In repose, his character is in harmony with the yin principle; in activity, his movement is in harmony with the yang principle. Therefore he who understands the music of heaven is not blamed by heaven or criticized by men ... It is said, \"In action he is like heaven. In repose he is like the earth ... Because his mind has found repose, therefore the creation pays homage to him.\u201d\n\n\n To understand \u201cthe music of heaven\u201d is to attain Repose, which is another way of describing the tranquility that comes with furthering the intent of the Self. The only dynamic line in the hexagram is in the minister's place just below the fifth-line ruler. He has the confidence of his sovereign and his actions therefore accord with heaven. We can turn to the Stoics to find an illustration of this idea:\n\n\n My will is simply that which comes to pass. For I esteem what God wills better than what I will. To Him will I cleave as His minister and attendant; having the same movements, the same desires, in a word the same will as He. \n-- Epictetus\n\n\n Thus we see that the hexagram can describe either one of two opposite conditions -- the intemperate Enthusiasm of ego-confidence (a synonym for Self-Deception), or the calm Repose of true SELF-confidence. The fifteenth and sixteenth hexagrams, each the inverse of the other, represent magnetic and dynamic aspects of the same general idea: Enthusiasm, when it emanates from the Self, is just Temperance in action.",

She may well enjoy the happiness of the time, but unable to contain herself, she erupts in boastful enthusiasm and calls undue attention to herself. Enthusiasm has thus been her undoing.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man is enthusiastic and boastful.\n Wing:  Although you may have a harmonious connection with someone in a high position, it does not necessarily indicate that you are on top of the situation. Furthermore, if you boast of your advantage, you will surely invite disaster.\n Editor: The meaning here can be subtle. Something (a strong emotion or attitude perhaps) is upsetting one\u2019s equilibrium. In addition to the usual meaning of \u201centhusiasm,\u201d this can symbolize any release or loss of energy (even despair, anguish, depression or grief \u2013 \u201cAnti-Enthusiasm,\u201d if you will), which serves to demolish Repose. Shaughnessy labels it Excess. Wilhelm and Blofeld render the Confucian commentary in terms of the obstruction or exhaustion of willpower. Ritsema/Karcher describe a loss of purpose; Cleary and Wu, blocked aspiration. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram changes to Shock, a plausible consequence in this case.\n\n\n But woe unto you that are rich! For ye have received your consolation.

The superior man, in his intercourse with the high, uses no flattery, and, in his intercourse with the low, no coarse freedom: does not this show that he knows the inception of things? Those beginnings are the slight stirrings of movement, and the earliest indications of good fortune or ill. The superior man sees them, and acts accordingly without waiting for the delay of a single day. As is said in the I Ching, `He is firm as a rock, and acts without waiting for the delay of a single day. With firm goodness there will be good fortune.' Firm as a rock, how should he have to wait a single day to ensure his knowing those beginnings and his course?

When we note that Legge mentions \"harmony and satisfaction\" instead of \"enthusiasm,\" we begin to see the meaning behind Blofeld's title of Repose. Indeed, his translation of the line begins: \"From repose, great results accrue...\" Wilhelm's version gives the idea of consolidating forces \"as a hair clasp gathers the hair.\" Psychologically interpreted, a process of integration is symbolized. The line can sometimes be a gentle admonition to have faith in your own unconscious processes to advance the Work.\n\n\n The One does not aspire to us, to move around us; we aspire to it, to move around it. Actually, we always move around it; but we do not always look. We are like a chorus grouped about a conductor who allow their attention to be distracted by the audience. If, however, they were to turn towards their conductor, they would sing as they should and would really be with him. We are always around The One. If we were not, we would dissolve and cease to exist. Yet our gaze does not remain fixed upon the One.

However, our discomfort is useful in causing us to seek out these attitudes which block our progress.\n Editor: At its most neutral, the image suggests a chronic condition currently not amenable to being cured.

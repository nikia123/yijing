    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Progress and success are suggested by the magnetic fifth line in the ruler's place. Although he has nearly crossed the stream, the young fox has not yet escaped from the midst of danger and calamity. Getting his tail wet means that the end does not reflect the intent of the beginning. Although the places of the different lines are not those appropriate to them, yet a dynamic and a magnetic line always respond to each other.",
        "Legge": "Unfinished Businessis the reverse of Completion: it means that the successful accomplishment of the matter at hand has not yet been realized; the crossing of the great stream is as yet incomplete. \n Some have wished that theI Chingmight have concluded with Completion, and the last hexagram have left us with the picture of human affairs all brought to good order. But this would not have been in harmony with the idea of change. Again and again it has been pointed out that we find in the book no idea of a perfect and abiding state. Just as the seasons of the year change and pursue an ever-recurring round, so it is with the phases of society. The reign of order has peaked and declined, and this hexagram calls us to renew the struggle to make things right again. It deals with the conduct necessary to secure this result. \n Not one of the lines in the hexagram is in its correct place -- all the dynamic lines are in magnetic places, and the magnetic lines are in dynamic places. At the same time, each of them has a proper correlate, so there is the possibility of some progress. \n The symbol of the fox suggests a want of caution on the part of those who try to remedy prevailing disorders. They are unsuccessful and thereby get themselves into trouble. Line two represents this state of mind -- he is dynamic in a magnetic place in the center of the trigram of Peril. He is restless, and attracted by his magnetic correlate in the fifth place, he will be incautious in taking action. The outcome of the issue will be different than what was intended at the beginning. \n The trigram of Water is below, and Fire above, showing how the two principles cannot act on each other profitably. This symbolizes the unregulated condition of general affairs now prevailing."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: Although many achievements fuel our growth, the ego is only the facilitator, not the doer. To ignore this truth creates negative consequences: don't destroy the Work! \n The Superior Man  critically examines the situation and re-checks his priorities. \n This hexagram represents the time before the climax of a cycle, just as the preceding figure symbolizes the time after the climax (and hence the transition to a new beginning). The Work is by no means \"almost over\" -- the lines all match as correlates, but every one of them unites \"upside-down,\" so to speak. (Turn the hexagram over, and then they are in perfect correlation.) That the superior man \"discriminates among the qualities of things, and the different positions they naturally occupy\" means that he knows that the correct positions of the lines (the ones they \"naturally occupy\") are as in hexagram number sixty-three, not this one. \n This \"backward correlation of lines\" is arguably a fair image of the relationship of thoughts and feelings in the average human psyche. The stresses of life are what eventually break up these mismatched correlates through endless cycles of stimulus and response until they finally all unite correctly in a hypothetical \"Completion of the Great Work.\" That this is an ideal rather than a humanly attainable goal is suggested in this quote from Shao Yung: \n\n\n The principle of the Way finds its full development in Heaven; the principle of Heaven, in Earth; the principle of Earth, in the myriad things; and that of the myriad things, in man. One who knows how the principles of Heaven, Earth, and all things find their full development in man can give full development to his people. \n\n\n For all practical purposes, it is wisest to aspire to attainable completions and realize that the Work's \"full development\" is the Self's, not the ego's responsibility. \n\n\n To strive for perfection is a high ideal. But I say: \"Fulfill something you are able to fulfill rather than run after what you will never achieve.\" Nobody is perfect. Remember the saying: \"None is good but God alone\" [Luke 18:19], and nobody can be. It is an illusion. We can modestly strive to fulfill ourselves and to be as complete human beings as possible, and that will give us trouble enough. \nJung -- The Tavistock Lectures\n\n\n The Judgment suggests that before any climax or resolution there may still exist an indeterminate amount of free choice to influence the outcome -- only the specific circumstances can suggest how much or how little. As always, the choices are defined within the structure of the situation. The magnetic ruler in the fifth place implies that a favorable outcome is possible, but only through clear perception and willpower can it come about. \n The conditional interpretation (boldface italics added) in both Legge's and Wilhelm's translation of the Judgment is necessary for its text to make sense. Note that Ritsema/Karcher define \"Without direction: Harvesting\" as: \"No plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events.\" This is a common oracle response, and sharpens the meaning here. Line one depicts the negative consequences of ignoring the Judgment\u2019s explicit message.",

        "Notes": "Siu: The man represses untimely actions through patient control of his strength, while remaining steadfast in his resolve. \n Wing: Even though you may know what must be done, the time is not right for action. Exercise patience and develop strength. If you maintain an inner determination to proceed when the opportunity presents itself, you will be successful. Do not allow this delay to turn you away from your goal. \n Editor:  Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu use the more forceful image of \"brakes\" instead of \"dragging a wheel.\"  The image is one of halting forward motion: Action will harm the Work unless it is stopped immediately. It is wise to remember Ritsema/Karcher's advice in the Judgment here: \"No plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events.\" \n\n\n For as man gradually emerges from unconsciousness and learns to subdue his instinctive nature, making it serve him and his needs, he possesses himself of the energy that formerly resided in the natural process. \nM.E.

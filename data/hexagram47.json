    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Oppressionwe see the dynamic lines covered and obscured by the magnetic. We see the attribute of Perilousness in the lower trigram going on to Cheerfulness in the upper. Who but the superior man is still able to advance although straitened by circumstances? The central position of the dynamic lines explains the good fortune of the great man who is firm and correct. As regards speech making, to be fond of argument or persuasion is the way to be reduced to extremity.",
        "Legge": "The written Chinese character of Oppression presents us with the picture of a tree within an enclosure. \"A plant,\" according to Williams, \"fading for want of room.\" \"A tree,\" according to T'ai Tung, \"not allowed to spread its branches.\" The image conveys the idea of being straitened and distressed, and the hexagram indicates how skilful management may relieve it. \n The two central places in the figure are occupied by dynamic lines, but line two is confined between one and three, which are magnetic; and line five (the ruler), as well as four (his minister), are covered by the magnetic sixth line. These conditions indicate the repression of good men by adversity. The K'ang-hsi editors imply that \"actions and not words\" are what are required in the case. \n Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and Cheerfulness that of the upper. The superior man, no matter how straitened, remains master of himself, and pursues his principled intent. The idea of speech making is found in the upper trigram, one of the attributes of which is the mouth, or speech, as well as Pleased Satisfaction. The pleading of the oppressed party still tries to make others pleased with him. \n Literally translated, the first sentence of the Image reads: \"A marsh with no water is Oppression.\" Chu Hsi says: \"The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above will become dry.\" \n Anthony:  Our belief in the ruling power as beneficial is shaken by doubt. This lack of steadfastness is a problem because it obstructs acceptance and its corrective power. We often receive this hexagram when we feel tired. The oppressiveness of doubt exhausts our inner resources."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: With enough will, success can be won. \"Actions speak louder than words.\u201d (i.e., The answer lies beyond the realm of reason and logic -- intuition furthers.) \n The Superior Man  stakes everything he's got on his will to succeed. \n In Oppressionwe have the image of a dry lake bed. Anyone who has ever seen alkali flats in the desert can easily understand this metaphor for Oppression -- almost nothing can live in such an environment. The following hexagram, The Well, is an upside-down image of Oppression depicting the opposite case of an unending source of nourishment flowing from deep beneath the surface of the earth. (A comparison of these two figures will reveal a great deal about the meaning of each.) \n To be under Oppression then, is to be cut off from all sustenance -- although there is water down below, it is presently inaccessible, and there is no nourishing flow of inner forces to the surface. This is a common, inevitable and potentially defeating experience for anyone doing serious inner work: \n\n\n People who try to practice the Tao can all keep steadfast when they are in easy circumstances, but many of them waver in determination when they are in difficult or perilous situations. They may change their minds because of the pressures of making a living, or they may slack in determination due to illness; their spirits may flag because of old age, or they may stop work because of obstruction by some obsession. All these are cases in which people do not exert the mind of Tao and are hindered by exhaustion, so they ultimately do not attain the Tao. \nT. Cleary \u2013 The Taoist I Ching\n\n\n Obviously, this is a dangerous situation, and we are told how to cope with it in the Confucian commentary, where it is observed that the lower trigram of Peril goes on to the upper trigram of Cheerfulness. These two trigrams are found in reversed sequence in hexagram number sixty, Restrictive Regulations, where a cheerful attitude is described as absolutely essential for the furtherance of the Work. The observations made there also apply here, and we see the superior man thereby enabled to advance under conditions that would utterly defeat lesser individuals. \n This Cheerfulness cannot be underestimated. When it comes naturally and isn't forced, it is a gift of grace. Suddenly one is enabled to face the most incredible hardships with a light heart. It isn't that you no longer care -- you still do the best you can to further the Work, but you do it with bemused detachment. \n\n\n The one thing the Jewish mystics never lost sight of was the suffering experienced in the arena of the profane. They did not retreat from this suffering, but sought instead to find meaning in it by living it. This is the core of mysticism. The temple in which the sacred marriage takes place is the world. \nC. Ponce -- Kabbalah\n\n\n Lines 2 and 5 specifically mention sacrifice: an important concept in theI Ching. Sacrifice is mentioned in lines 17:6, 45:2, 46:2, 46:4, 47:2, 47:5, 63:5, and in the Judgment of hexagram 20. Note that in each case sincerity is specifically cited as essential to success. \nSincere 1: marked by genuineness: as a: free of dissimulation: not hypocritical: REAL, TRUE, HONEST...\n Very often, the \u201csincerity\u201d of our sacrifices involves following the dictates of the Work whether we fully understand them or not. Much that takes place in the Work is incomprehensible to ego consciousness; for example, changes often occur within the psyche which we only experience as strange dreams. Yet somehow, perhaps months later, we suddenly realize that we no longer act in a certain way or have lost interest in something that used to be of compelling importance. Our sacrifices are necessary for these changes to take place, even if they don't immediately make sense to us. \n\n\n\"With sacrifice shall you nourish the gods; and may the gods nourish you. Thus nourishing one another, you will obtain the Highest Good. \"The gods, nourished by sacrifice, will bestow on you the enjoyments you desire.\" He is verily a thief who enjoys the things that they give without offering to them anything in return. \nThe Bhagavad-Gita \n\n\n Each of Cleary\u2019s Taoist (1) and Buddhist (2) commentaries provides valuable insights into how much courage is required to follow the dictates of the Work at its more advanced levels. Take comfort that others before you have persevered and survived: \u201cDeveloped people accomplish their will by living out their destiny.\u201d",

Discouragement creates a pattern for failure that will continue if not halted now. \n Anthony:  As long as we are influenced by doubt, we are blocked from seeing the solution. We must firmly resist doubt and hopelessness to restore open-mindedness. The way out will show itself at the right time. \n Editor: Despite Blofeld's note on this line, it does not necessarily always intimate complete failure. In the most neutral sense, it's an image of stalemate, though there is a definite suggestion that this is due to one's own failing in something. Self-pity is hinted at, as well as lack of clarity. Some kind of illusion prevails. There is a possibility that things aren't as bad as they seem, or your attitude is making them worse than they need to be. The line can sometimes indicate that you have misunderstood a previous hexagram. \n\n\n There are two wrongs the soul commits. The first is its descent; the second, the evil done after arrival here below. The first is punished by the very conditions of its descent. Punishment for the second is passage once more into other bodies, there to remain at greater or less length according to the judgment of its deserts. \n (The word \"judgment\" indicates that this takes place as a result of divine law.) If, however, its perversity goes beyond all measure, the soul incurs an even more severe penalty administered by avenging daimons. \nPlotinus -- The Enneads\n\n A.

        "Notes": "Siu:  The man is apparently well off but is actually inwardly depressed. He is unable to solve the ordinary problems of life and develop his basic principles. He is rescued by the prince, who is looking for able helpers. However, he must first be patient until the unseen obstacles are overcome by prayers and sacrifices. \n Wing:  An Adversity facing you now comes about from boredom. Indulgences and pleasures may come too easily for you. Try giving yourself to a worthwhile cause. There is redemption in such altruistic actions. \n Editor:  The core idea here is that a sacrifice of some kind is necessary to relieve your oppression. Sacrifice is a universal principle deeply rooted in the unconscious psyche. The general idea behind it is the offering of something valuable to obtain something more valuable, which may not be immediately obvious; it is an act of faith and acknowledgment of subservience to higher guidance. In terms of the Work, this is the ego's sacrifice of its autonomy to the Self. Here the situation is the seeming contradiction of being oppressed while surrounded by plenty, so the sacrifice could involve not partaking of what is readily available. Compare with 45:2, which is created if this is the only changing line. \n\n\n Sacrifice, \"making sacred\" (from the Latin sacrum facere) psychologically entails a surrender of ego libido to the service and intents of the transpersonal entelechy ... Transformation rests on sacrifice, on making \"holy\" by giving up and rendering to the transpersonal, \"sacred\" powers what one \"has\" while remaining what one essentially \"is.\" One submits to change, death and loss of some aspects of one's being, abilities or possessions, while refusing to \"curse God, and die\" (Job 2:9), in other words, refusing to let go of one's trust in life and one's central core of integrity and Self. \nE.C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing\n\n A. Starving amid plenty, one has almost made a connection with the source of truth. Give up your illusions and wait. \n B. What you seek is all around you, and the connection is immanent. Have the will to sacrifice an option to relieve your oppression. \n C.

To enter one's palace and not see one's wife is inauspicious. Wilhelm/Baynes: He rests on a hard line. This bodes misfortune. Blofeld: The firm line just below him. His not finding his wife symbolizes bad luck. Ritsema/Karcher: Riding a solid indeed. Not auspicious indeed. Cleary (2): Not seeing the wife is not a good sign. Wu: An unfortunate omen. \n Legge: For a full explanation of the third line, Chu Hsi refers the reader to what Confucius said on it: \"If one be distressed by what need not distress him, his name is sure to be disgraced; if he lay hold on what he should not touch, his life is sure to be imperiled. In disgrace and danger, his death will soon come; is it possible for him in such circumstances to see his wife?\" The K'ang-hsi editors say here: \"The subjects of the three magnetic lines (one, three and six) are all unable to cope correctly with the oppression of their circumstances. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The third line, able either to advance or retreat, advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to his family and finds no one to receive him: a graphic portrayal of the results of reckless action.\"",
        "Notes": "Siu: The man is indecisively unable to deal with adversity and is oppressed by something which should not oppress him. He leans on things like thorns and thistles, which are hazardous yet cannot support him. \n Wing:  You allow yourself to become oppressed by things that are not oppressive. \n You put your faith in things that cannot support you. You are unable to see your priorities although they are obvious. This brings misfortune. \n Editor:  This line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. The rock is often a symbol of eternity, and is seen as a dwelling place for spiritual beings, hence: a transcendental reality or \"eternal verity.\" In fairy tales a barrier of thorns is often created by an evil witch or other negative magnetic force -- the feminine principle in its destructive aspect. This barrier is usually what separates the hero from the sleeping maiden, his unconscious anima or feminine soul. A house or palace is the whole psyche. (\"In my father's house are many mansions.\" -- John 14:2) The wife of course, is the contra-sexual correlate: in a man, the anima, or emotional-feeling component of his psyche. (A woman receiving this line should just reverse the symbolism and see it as the animus, or logical-thinking component of her psyche.) Putting all these symbols together we receive an image of a situation which is somehow contrary to \"the laws of nature.\" Both the frowning rock (yang) and the thorns (yin) are opposed to the situation, so no union can possibly take place: \"He does not see his wife.\"  If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number twenty-eight, Critical Mass, with a corresponding line which indicates a position of extreme vulnerability to danger. This line is an unambiguous warning that your situation is untenable -- both dynamic and magnetic forces are against you. Ritsema/Karcher translate \"pitfall\" as: \"Leads away from the experience of meaning; stuck and exposed to danger, unable to take in the situation; flow of life and spirit is blocked...\" Wilhelm alludes to \"immanent death,\" which, of course, should be interpreted symbolically in most cases. \n\n\n He disowned the God who made him, dishonored the Rock, his salvation. \nDeuteronomy 32: 15 \n\n A. You are out of touch with reality -- resisting a situation that you should accept. \n B.

        "Notes": "Siu:  The man's good intentions to help mankind are obstructed from above and below, especially by the bureaucrats. Gradually the situation improves. In the meantime, all he can do is to maintain inner composure, as in offering sacrifices to heaven. \n Wing: There exists a frustrating lack of information within your milieu. Bureaucracy stands in the way of progress. Those who need help are stranded. All you can do is maintain your composure until things take a promised turn for the better. \n Editor:  The situation of line five is \"between a rock and a hard place.\" The nose symbolizes intuition -- to have the nose cut off suggests that we have no insight into our situation; when our feet are cut off, we \"don't have a leg to stand on\" and our foundation is undermined. Psychologically, the symbolism implies that the stress of the position is caused by a higher power: the Self; if so, the stress is necessary to effect an inner transformation of some sort. We are asked to sacrifice our need to understand the incomprehensible and submit to the requirements of the time. This line changes the hexagram to number forty, Liberation, suggesting that through submission toOppression one eventually attains freedom. \n\n\n The death of the physical body is one of the supremer forms of the principle of Crucifixion. One which equals it is the \"death of initiation.\" This is the comparatively high initiation where the whole life is dedicated to the service of the Spirit ... and the initiate instead of dying for a principle, lives out his life in accordance with a principle, and this can be a far harder thing ... The Great Work comes first, whatever the cost. \nGareth Knight --Qabalistic Symbolism \n\n A. Without intuition you have no power-base -- submit to the lessons that a restricted situation offers you. Sacrifice your ego impulses. \n B. You are oppressed by powers outside of your awareness. For the benefit of the Work, sacrifice your autonomy and your need to understand, and attain eventual liberation."

        "Legge": "The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject straitened, as if bound with creepers; or in a high and dangerous position, and saying to herself: \"If I move, I shall repent it.\"  If she does repent of former errors, there will be good fortune in her going forward.",
        "Wilhelm/Baynes": "He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uncertainly and says, \"Movement brings remorse.\" If one feels remorse over this, and makes a start, good fortune comes. [A man is oppressed by bonds that can easily be broken. The distress is drawing to an end. But he is still irresolute; he is still influenced by the previous conditions and fears that he may have cause for regret if he makes a move. But as soon as he grasps the situation, changes his mental attitude, and makes a firm decision, he masters oppression.]",
        "Blofeld": "Entangled with creepers and tottering uneasily, he voices regret for his actions. Provided regret is felt, to advance will bring good fortune. [We shall certainly suffer, but sincere regret will stand us in good stead.]",
        "Liu": "Oppressed by vines, he moves uneasily and says, \"Movement brings regret.\" If he feels regret, then sets forth -- good fortune.",
        "Ritsema/Karcher": "Confined, tending-towards trailing creepers. Tending-towards the unsteady [and] unsettled. Spoken-thus: stirring-up repenting possesses repenting. Chastising significant.",
        "Shaughnessy": "Entangled in the creeping vines in the doubled rafters. Say \"regretting the level;\" there is regret; determination is auspicious.",
        "Cleary (1)": "Exhausted at an impasse, in distress, is called regret over action; there is regret. It is auspicious to go on an expedition.",
        "Cleary (2)": "Exhausted in difficulty, in distress, thinking there will be regret if one acts, one does regret. Going forth leads to good fortune. [At the extreme of Exhaustion, one should go on actively. If one is negative, weak, and feeble in ability, one doubts whether one\u2019s ideas are right; this is like being tangled up and ill at ease. Fearing that if one acts one will regret it, one always shrinks back, regrettably. Therefore sages go directly forth to good fortune, resolving this.]",
        "Wu": "He is surrounded by tangling vines and besieged with weariness. He says to himself: \u201cIf I would be regretful for doing nothing or doing something, I might as well do something to take my chances of getting out of hardship.\u201d",
        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge: Her spirit and action are unsuitable, but she repents of her former errors and goes on to good fortune. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is not yet suitable. If there is remorse, this is an auspicious change. Blofeld: The entangling creepers are indicated by the unsuitable position of this line. Feeling regret is a means to obtain good fortune. Ritsema/Karcher: Not yet appropriate indeed. Significance moving indeed. Cleary (2): One has not hit the mark. There is regret because of regretting action; good fortune is to go. Wu: He is not responsive. This would be a good move. \n Legge: Line six is at the top of the figure, where the distress may be supposed to reach its height. She appears bound and on a perilous summit, but her extremity is also her opportunity. She is moved to think of repenting, and if she does so and goes forward, all will be fortunate.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man appears to be in the depths of distress. His fears and irresolute concerns over previous failures are not conducive to progress. But the oppressive bonds can be broken if he repents of his error and grasps the situation firmly. \n Wing: Do not allow difficulties in the recent past to create in you attitudes about the future. If you have become cynical or opinionated, you are lost. Improve your attitude, and the situation will follow. Good fortune. \n Editor: The dominant idea is that the subject of the sixth line (\"at the top\") is fettered only by vegetation which presumably could be cast off with little trouble. (This might suggest a long-standing dilemma or limiting belief: vines and creepers only entangle those who are not active enough get out of their way.) It follows that only the illusion that they can't be cast off prevents liberation. \n\n\n Our common reaction to painful difficulty, consciously or unconsciously, is \"what have I done to deserve this?\" \"How can I get out of this?\" \"How can there be a God if this is allowed to happen?\" Rarely do we ask, \"What new dimension of experiencing does this try to teach me?\" \"Wherein am I being challenged?\" \nE.

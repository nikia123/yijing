    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "Inner Truth shows two magnetic lines occupying the innermost part of the hexagram, with dynamic lines in the centers of the trigrams. We see the attributes of Cheerfulness and Flexible Penetration -- sincerity thus symbolized reaches even to pigs and fishes and will transform the country. We see one riding on the symbol of Wood, which forms an empty boat -- hence it is advantageous to cross the great stream. The virtue of Inner Truth requires firm correctness and shows the proper response of man to heaven.",
        "Legge": "Inner Truth denotes the highest quality of man, giving its possessor the power to prevail with spiritual beings, with other men and with lower creatures. There are two magnetic lines in the center and two dynamic lines above and below them. The magnetic lines represent the heart and mind free from all preoccupation, without any consciousness of self. The two dynamic lines immediately above and below them are each in the center of their respective trigram, and denote the solid virtue of one so free from selfishness. \n The trigram of Wood above the trigram for a Lake or Marsh suggests a boat crossing the great stream. The pigs and fishes symbolize the rudest and most obstinate of men. Ch'eng-tzu observes: \"We have in the sincerity shown in the upper trigram superiors condescending to those below them in accordance with their peculiarities, and we have in that of the lower those below delighted to follow their superiors. The combination of these two things leads to the transformation of the country and state.\""
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  It is a great accomplishment when Inner Truthalters archetypal forces within the psyche. The ego\u2019s devotion to the Work is the means to this end. \n The Superior Man  carefully differentiates his options and avoids drastic measures. (Can sometimes mean: \"Don't act until you are sure of all the facts.\") \n Anyone who monitors his dreams and other images knows that the unconscious is a continuous wellspring of psychic energy. Jung has observed that we are probably dreaming all of the time -- the only reason we don't usually notice this is because the conscious mind is so powerful that the more subtle manifestations of the psyche are eclipsed. Since consciousness consists of only the upper layers of a deep continuum of awareness it is obvious that we are being continuously \"created from within.\" The ultimate source of our being is not easily accessible, but all of the empirical evidence points to a \"Self\" which transcends the space-time continuum -- i.e., lives in another \"dimension.\" \n\n\n The capacity to nullify space and time must somehow inhere in the psyche, or, to put it another way, the psyche does not exist wholly in time and space. It is very probable that only what we call consciousness is contained in space and time, and that the rest of the psyche, the unconscious, exists in a state of relative spacelessness and timelessness. \nJung --Letters\n\n\n This seemingly exotic concept was written by Jung in 1939, yet today the theories of the quantum physicists are approaching the point where awareness itself will be recognized as space-time transcendent. \n\n\n In the modern Kaluza-Klein theory all the forces of nature, not merely gravity, are treated as manifestations of spacetime structure. What we normally call gravity is a warp in the four spacetime dimensions of our perceptions, while the other forces are reduced to higher-dimensional spacewarps. All the forces of nature are revealed as nothing more than hidden geometry at work ... There is a deep compulsion to believe in the idea that the entire universe, including all the apparently concrete matter that assails our senses, is in reality only a frolic of convoluted nothingness, that in the end the world will turn out to be a sculpture of pure emptiness, a self-organized void. \nPaul Davies -- Superforce \n\n\n The physicists now hypothesize an eleven-dimensional universe, and state that the seven \"extra\" dimensions are somehow \"rolled up to a very small size\" so that they are not apparent to our senses. If we are going to hypothesize such fantastic realms it is more elegant to hypothesize consciousness itself as emanating from an extra-dimensional source. This is the Pleroma of the Gnostics and Alchemists, the upper and lower worlds of shamanism, or in Jungian parlance: the Objective Psyche or Collective Unconscious. \n The familiar spacetime of our conscious experience consists of three linear dimensions, plus time. Time is considered a dimension, but not like the other three -- one can go up, down, forward and backward, to the left or right at will, but one cannot go back to this morning or forward to next Thursday afternoon. The time dimension is a continuous \"now\" and we experience it and the other three dimensions from the reference point of consciousness -- we are the center from which all dimensions radiate. Consciousness is like time in that it is always \"now,\" and since consciousness emerges from within in a continuous and autonomous flow, we can legitimately hypothesize that we emanate from a power source in another dimension. We are a kind of continuous explosion from within -- a microcosmic version of the \"Big Bang\" which originated the universe, and which, incidentally, is still exploding-expanding outward into space. \n\n\n If everything that is recognizable is so only because it has separated itself from the \"all and nothingness,\" leaving its complementary half behind in the unmanifested state, then the earth too must have its complementary half in the unmanifested state, and the force of gravitation it exerts on all the creatures and objects living on it is the striving for reunification between the earth and its unmanifested complementary half which has been left behind in the void as its negative reflection. The earth's gravitational pull thus draws all the earth towards the void which stands beyond time and space, in order to bring about this reunion. If the earth were to yield, all the earth and everything on it would disappear into the center, into the void. But that would be a return to the paradisiacal unity -- to God -- to bliss! \nElisabeth Haich -- Initiation\n\n\n The image of the hexagramInner Truth gives us the idea of an \"empty\" center -- as good an image as could be devised from the structural components of the trigrams to show the inner source of human consciousness. The pigs and fishes of the Judgment are the archetypal complexes which must be tamed through the process of the Work, and to \"cross the great stream\" with firm correctness is to accomplish this holy task. \n\n\n Through all ages men have sought, and some have found; there is a door through which we can pass out on to the higher planes, but that door is within the soul, it is an enlargement of consciousness whereby we perceive these things to which we have hitherto been blind, and from such perception comes the sense of reality which is lacking while we perceive nothing but appearances. Whoso has this wider vision is freed from the limitations of the five physical senses; his memory extends back beyond birth, and his hopes go forward beyond death ... Having all aspects of his own nature harmoniously developed, he is at one with all aspects of the universe, nothing is alien to him, and no form of existence is hostile. The path of life is open before him and he treads it with joy. \nD. Fortune -- The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage",

However, the K'ang-hsi editors contend that with the exception of lines three and six, the concept of correlation should be discarded from the study of this hexagram. Here sincerity is focused on inner truth, and this is the source of its power. \"No change has come over his purpose\" means that sincerity, perfect in and of itself, continues undisturbed by outside influences.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man relies on his inner stability and preparedness, which are the basis of a correct attitude toward the world. If he seeks secret ties, however, his peace of mind and inmost sincerity will be jeopardized. \n Wing:  Concentrate now upon your inner virtue. Rely upon your principles and those things you know to be true about your nature. Good fortune will come with this attitude. If you look outside of yourself for help, you may succumb to chaos and all subsequent action will be uncentered and improper. \n Editor:  There is some serious disagreement about the proper translation of this line. Wilhelm speaks of \"being prepared;\" Liu renders it as an injunction to \"ponder carefully.\" Blofeld's version is a complete non-sequitur, and we can't help but wonder about the meaning of the \"swallow\" in Ritsema/Karcher's version. Nevertheless, all of the Confucian commentaries are closely analogous, so we can use it as our point of reference. The image is one of an inner centeredness which seems threatened. The proper response is an egoless receptivity to experience which has its secure foundation in Self-reliance. One comes from one's center, ignoring peripheral inner turmoil and its reflection in outer temptation, and thereby flows with Tao. \n\n\n It was even then only after the Heyoka ceremony, in which I performed my dog vision, that I had the power to practice as a medicine man, curing sick people; and many I cured with the power that came through me. Of course it was not I who cured. It was the power from the outer world, and the visions and ceremonies had only made me like a hole through which the power could come to the two-leggeds. If I thought that I was doing it myself, the hole would close up and no power could come through. Then everything I could do would be foolish. \nBlack Elk \n\n A.

Blofeld:  `Its young ones follow suit' indicates heartfelt desire.  Ritsema/Karcher: Centering the heart desiring indeed. Cleary (2): The fledgling joining in is the heart\u2019s desire. Wu: The harmony comes from within. \n The Master said:  \"The superior man occupies his apartment and sends forth his words.

If his words be evil, they will awaken opposition at a distance of more than a thousand miles \u2013 how much more will they do so in the inner circle! Words issue from one's person, and proceed to affect the people. Actions proceed from what is near, and their effects are seen at a distance. Words and action are the spring and hinge of the superior man. The movement of that hinge and spring determines glory or disgrace. His words and actions move Heaven and Earth -- may he be careless in regard to them?\" \n Legge:  The young ones of the crane are represented by line one. The symbolism suggests two men brought together by their sympathy in virtue. The subject of the line is the effect of sincerity.

The deeds you do, the words you speak, resonate in the hearts and minds of others near and far. You may expect a fortunate and beneficial response from your environment. \n Editor:  We see here a hidden mother bird calling to her young to share a cup of spirits. (Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all translate \"hidden retirement\" as \"shade.\") The image is of a mother who cannot be seen -- i.e., a hidden source. Psychologically interpreted, this suggests the inner Self, and the shade suggests the darkness of the unconscious from which the Self calls to us. The young birds who respond to the call are the complexes of the psyche, including, of course, the conscious ego-complex. Despite conscious negative associations of alcohol with intoxication, \"spirits\" are a common dream symbol for the action of the spirit on consciousness. (Aqua Vitae, literally: \"water of life,\" means alcohol or hard liquor.) The overall image then is one of the Self and its complexes united by their common \"spirit.\" \n\n\n As concerning the most sovereign form of soul in us we must conceive that heaven has given it to each man as a guiding genius -- that part which we say dwells in the summit of our body and lifts us from earth toward our celestial affinity, like a plant whose roots are not in earth, but in the heavens. And this is most true, for it is to the heavens, whence the soul first came to birth, that the divine part attaches the head or root of us and keeps the whole body upright. \nPlato -- The Timaeus \n\n A.

Misfortune\u201d (Wilhelm). Here, line three is unduly influenced by her sixth line correlate, who is portrayed as a crowing cock: an egotistical sham. Blofeld, Shaughnessy and Cleary (1) describe an enemy; Ritsema/Karcher call it \u201cacquiring antagonism.\u201d Whatever it is, the influence is not consistent with proper management of the Work. This suggests the psychic processes of the average human being. With her choices largely influenced by unconscious forces (which her correlate would probably call \"free will\"), her life is largely determined by circumstances beyond her control. At its most neutral, the line images the waxing and waning of fortune: \"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.\" \n\n\n But this duality would seem to alternate; what is victor today is the vanquished tomorrow; what guides us today becomes secondary and subordinate tomorrow. And everything is equally mechanical, equally independent of will, and leads equally to no aim of any kind. The understanding of duality in oneself begins with the realization of mechanicalness and the realization of the difference between what is mechanical and what is conscious. This understanding must be preceded by the destruction of the self-deceit in which a man lives who considers even his most mechanical actions to be volitional and conscious and himself to be single and whole. \nGurdjieff \n\n A.

        "Commentary": "Confucius/Legge: Chanticleer tries to mount to Heaven, but how can such an effort continue long? Wilhelm/Baynes: How could such a one last long? Blofeld: For how could this continue for long?  Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore permitting long-living indeed? Cleary (2): How can the rooster who ascends to the skies last? Wu: \n How long can it last? \n Legge:  Line six should be magnetic, but is dynamic, and coming after line five, what can he accomplish? His efforts will be ineffectual and self-destructive. He is symbolized as a cock -- literally: \"The plumaged voice.\" But a cock is not fitted to fly high, and will only hurt himself in the attempt.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  Mere words cannot be relied upon. Overdependence on them leads to bad results. \n Wing: Your character has developed to a point where you can make a formalized appeal for help and allegiance in attaining ambitious aims. However, your position is not correct for such aspirations. The pursuit of these aims brings unhappiness and remorse. \n Editor:  The cock is a proud and stubborn bird: loud and aggressive, it is an appropriate symbol of a deluded ego. [Cocksure: \"Given to or marked by overconfidence, presumptuousness, lack of thoroughness or cockiness.\"] The sound of a cock's crowing suggests proud words or vain ideas. His correlate is the weak and inconstant, \u201cdrumming and sobbing\u201d third line, and he can be seen as an over-confident ego aspiring to lead the psyche to glory -- an illusion which can only fail and thereby retard the progress of the Work. At worst, this implies bad faith; at best it suggests ignorance and illusion. \n\n\n Reliance on one's apparent self [ego] leads to ruin. To presume to be all-knowing is extremely harmful. Self-reliance or self-confidence means faith in the higher self. To persist in remaining what one already is or in holding on to one's preconceived opinions at any cost -- such self-importance is unprofitable. \nSwami Turlyananda \n\n A. Ego pride destroys the Work. \n B. Don't pretend to know or try to understand what is beyond your comprehension. \n\n April 11, 2001, 4/25/06"

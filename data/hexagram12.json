The great and the good decline; the mean approach.  [When heaven and earth cease to co-operate, no growth is possible and stagnation results. The trigram (earth), when in intercourse with heaven, has the auspicious meaning of glad acceptance; but, when separated from heaven, it represents weakness and darkness, etc.]",

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "The unfavorable auspice of Divorcement is because heaven and earth are not in communication, and all things consequently fail to unite. High and low, superior and inferior, do not meet in union, and there are no well- regulated states in the kingdom. The lower trigram consists of magnetic lines, and the upper of dynamic lines: darkness is within, clarity without; weakness within, strength without. The lower trigram represents the advancing inferior men, the upper trigram represents the retreating superior men.",
        "Legge": "The form of Divorcementis the exact opposite of Harmony, and much of what has been said on the interpretation of that will apply to this. Divorcement is the hexagram of the seventh month when the process of growth has ended and increasing decay may be expected. The trigram of Earth is below and that of Heaven is above, and since it is always proper for the lower trigram to take the initiative, how can Earth take the place of Heaven? As in nature, it is Heaven that originates, not Earth, and in a state the upper classes must take the initiative, and not the lower."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment: The time is out of joint -- decadence waxes and virtue is mocked.\n The Superior Man refuses to participate in the prevailing disorder. \n If the preceding hexagram images the fruitful union of heaven and earth in a holy marriage, this figure shows their Divorcement.\nDivorcement: The act, process, or an instance of separating things closely joined -- the state of being separated.\n To receive this figure without changing lines suggests that you are separated from truth or virtue, or that for the moment at least, the situation at hand affords no possibility of reconciliation. During such conditions it would be the height of folly to \"wed oneself\" to the prevailing disorder.\n Note however that every line but the third shows some kind of effort to reunite that which has been separated. The first shows an alliance of closely related elements bent on serving the Work; line two depicts a kind of holding action which is necessary to allow a superior element to prevail. The third line identifies recalcitrant forces which prevent union, and four depicts another alliance -- a higher octave of its first line correlate. Line five images nearly complete re-unification and six shows the end of Divorcement. These images suggest that although disunion prevails, the energy in the situation is promoting connection.\n As regards the Judgment:\n\n\n Plato seems to have expressed Confucius' idea perfectly. In The Republic he makes Socrates say that the true philosopher, finding himself in an evil environment, \"will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way ... he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.\" \nH.G. Creel -- Confucius and the Chinese Way",

        "Blofeld": "When grass is uprooted, what is attached to it is pulled up as well. Righteous persistence brings good fortune and success.

This sort of contradiction is common with bottom and top lines, which are often held to precede or follow after the main situation.]",

Blofeld:  The omen is favorable owing to continued loyalty to the rule. [The ruler is now surrounded by evil men or men of mean attainments, but the Superior Man continues to help him.]  Ritsema/Karcher:  Purpose located-in a chief indeed. Cleary (2): The will is in the leader. Wu: Because the aspiration is to serve the king.\n Legge: Naturally we should expect the advance of the first of the three magnetic lines to lead to evil.

He brings along his associates, who are like the sod clinging to the uprooted grass.\n Wing: If it is not possible to change or influence the current environment while preserving the principles that have formed your character, then withdraw completely. Success will come to you in a more profound sense than could be realized from a compromising situation. Important associates may leave with you. Good fortune.\n Editor:  Compare this with the first line of the preceding hexagram. In some circumstances the meaning can be similar to the proverb: \"Birds of a feather flock together.\" In another sense, if \"grass roots\" are the foundation, source, bare essence of something, then the first line can represent the roots of the lower trigram, which is seen as a clump of grass or \"cluster of inferior forces.\" The image suggests the separation of oneself from an entrenched position and moving upward. Confucius sees this movement as being in accord with the will of \"the ruler\" -- in psychological terms: the will of the Self.\n\n\n Endeavor to ascend into thyself, gathering in from the body all thy members which have been dispersed and scattered into multiplicity from that unity which once abounded in the greatness of its power.

The subject of the second line is a great man, and occupies the place in the center -- if, when confronted by difficulties he cherishes the attributes of patience and obedience, he will soon have a happy issue out of the distress.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  The man achieves good fortune by patience and obedience to his superior, who resolves his uncertainties. The great man, however, acts independently in meeting the challenge of the circumstances.\n Wing:  It is better to quietly accept Stagnation than to attempt to influence the leaders and willing victims of the situation. By remaining apart, you will not corrupt your principles. Success is indicated.\n Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the ego must always be aware of two realms of power in the psyche: the differentiated complexes and the integrating principle, or Self. In unifying its components, the Self sometimes uses strategies which are beyond the comprehension of the ego. When such tactics are in effect, it is time for the ego to \"bear and endure\" in good faith.\n\n\n Thus the Hermetic treatise of rebirth describes the stages by which in the mystical situation the astral soul is dissolved and the spiritual self generated: one by one, the demonic powers (hailing from the Zodiac) are ousted from the subject and replaced by \"powers of God\" descending into it by grace and with their entrance progressively \"composing\" the new person. The initiate, ascetically prepared, is throughout receptive rather than active. With the dissolving of the former self he passes outside and beyond himself into a different being. \n-- H. Jonas --The Gnostic Religion\n\n A. Subordinate elements endure an impasse: the Self refuses to pander to the illusions of its satellites. Sit tight and allow the situation to evolve.

But he does not have the strength to carry out his evil purpose.\n Wing:  Because of questionable methods and motives used to attain your position, your plans will not come to fruition. There is some shame in this, but therefore improvement.\n Editor:  Wilhelm and Liu both use the plural here: \"They bear shame,\" and \"They bear with humiliation.\" I have received this line when it referred to autonomous elements (inner complexes or other people) influencing the situation; I have also received it directed at a consciously held attitude, as well as describing another person\u2019s hidden agenda. Part of the idea here is that for one to mend one's ways one must first recognize one's errors and \"feel shame\" about them. The prognosis is then favorable -- i.e.: \"Go thy way and sin no more.\" Sometimes this line can be a reprimand for asking the oracle a question you can figure out for yourself.\n\n\n We are still as possessed by our autonomous psychic contents as if they were gods. Today they are called phobias, compulsions, and so forth, or in a word, neurotic symptoms.

If you sincerely hear a calling to the task and are in harmony with the cosmos, you and your associates will benefit. If you simply appoint yourself to the position of leader, confusion could result.\n Editor:  Psychologically, the idea here is that when the ego follows the principles of the Work, or the will of the Self (which amounts to the same thing), other elements within the psyche (\"his companions\") are thereby induced to fall into line.\n\n\n [Once unity has been achieved] the work of destiny can be commenced, which is the functioning as a part of God\u2019s evolving Universe which [the individual], as a spirit, undertook to carry out in the first place...

The instinctual drives themselves may change character and consequently the needs for suppressive discipline or sublimation can be lessened. Much of what formerly seemed evil, or at least compulsively disturbing, reveals itself as merely primitive and therefore capable of constructive growth. The instinctual drives thus transformed and matured cease to be sources of moral danger, temptation or sin; instead they become the originators of new creative impulses and possibilities of expression which eventually widen the scope of the personality and with it the whole life. \nE.C.

        "Confucius/Legge": "Discipline describes the masses who make up the army, and the firm correctness referred to means a morally correct intent. When the leader uses the masses with such correctness, he may fulfill the ruler's will. The focus of strength in the second line is responded to by his proper correlate in the ruler's place. Although action is dangerous, it accords with the best sentiments of men, and although the leader may distress the country the people will still follow him -- there will be good fortune and no error.",
        "Legge": "Discipline is symbolized here by the conduct of a military expedition. The arrangement of the lines suggests the idea of a general surrounded by his troops. The dynamic yang line in the center of the lower trigram has the confidence of the magnetic ruler in the fifth place. Entire trust is reposed in him because he is strong and correct. He is referred to as an old and experienced man, hence all of his enterprises will succeed.\n Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and Docility or Accordance with Others, that of the upper. War is like poison to a country -- painful, and potentially ruinous, and yet the people will endure it on behalf of the sovereign whom they love and respect.\n In regard to the Image, Chu Hsi says: \"As the water is not outside the earth, so soldiers are not outside the people. Therefore if a ruler is able to nourish the people, he can get the multitudes for his armies.\""
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Discipline directed by willpower and serious intent advances the Work. Or: With experienced judgment and proper will and intent there will be a good outcome.\n The Superior Man  trains and nourishes his powers to build an invincible unity. \n The English word \"infantry,\" meaning foot soldiers (the backbone of any army), is derived from the French word enfant, meaning infant, or child. This ancient association was made because a good military officer was expected to treat his soldiers as if they were his own children -- with a stern but loving discipline designed to improve their character. This concept is what the Image alludes to when it says: \u201cThe superior man nourishes and educates the people, and collects from among them a mighty army.\u201d  Psychologically interpreted the idea is that the ego-complex is the general officer in the second line that nourishes, educates and controls the other complexes within the psyche. This can only be accomplished through discipline, and thus I have chosen that name for the hexagram rather than the more usual title of The Army.\n With the only dynamic line of the hexagram placed in the center of the lower trigram we have an image of the position of the ego-complex in relation to the rest of the psyche. The magnetic ruler in line five represents the Self, isolated from direct physical involvement and dependent upon the dynamic ego to carry out the Work in the material dimension. The seventh hexagram, therefore, shows the Work from the ego's point of view.\n Hexagram number eight, Holding Together, is the inverse of this image, and shows the Work from the Self's point of view outside of spacetime. There it is the dynamic fifth line ruler who is the focal point -- an image of the Self surrounded by its satellites. In that dimension the second line ego-complex is only another magnetic complex in the company of other magnetic complexes. Ideally, the lower complexes within the psyche should be magnetic in relation to a dynamic ego, but the ego is always magnetic in relation to the dynamic Self. From the Self's point of view all of its complexes are its magnetic \"children,\" or \"infantry.\" Hexagrams seven and eight should be studied together as reversed images to get a full comprehension of each.\n The images in the lines of Discipline all deal with the management of forces as a coordinated whole -- as long as they are under the firm command of the ego (who is only a general carrying out the orders of the Self), things proceed successfully. If the Discipline breaks down and the ego- general loses control, defeat is certain.\n\n\n Narutomi Hyogo said, \"What is called winning is defeating one's allies. Defeating one's allies is defeating oneself, and defeating oneself is vigorously overcoming one's own body. It is as though a man were in the midst of ten thousand allies but not one were following him. If one hasn't previously mastered his mind and body, he will not defeat the enemy.\" \nYamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai",

Be sure as well that you are organized. Without order, your affairs will end in chaos and misfortune. Discipline is the key here.\n Editor:  There is a certain ambiguity in this line, and an implicit warning to maintain total awareness. It doesn't tell you that you are right or wrong -- it only makes a general observation: a truism. The image portrays the necessity of a correct hierarchy of forces (ideas, concepts) to attain any goal. (If you don't know the proper sequence of numbers you cannot open a combination lock.) Crudely, make sure you thoroughly understand your situation before taking action. The implication is that you may not apprehend some crucial aspect of the matter at hand, hence need more or better data. In some contexts, \"ordinances\" or \"law\" may refer to the laws of nature. Compare with line 6.\n\n\n The senses of the wise man obey his mind, his mind obeys his intellect, his intellect obeys his ego, and his ego obeys the Self. \nKatha Upanishad\n\n A.

Thus it is here also. Every life is a warfare, and that long and various.

    "Commentary": {
        "Confucius/Legge": "In Followingthe dynamic trigram places itself under the magnetic. We see in them the attributes of Movement and Pleasure. Through firm correctness all under heaven will be found following at such a time.",
        "Legge": "Following comes after Enthusiasm, the symbol of harmony and satisfaction. When these conditions prevail men are sure to follow.  The hexagram includes the ideas of both following others and being followed by others.(Emphasis mine, Ed.) The good auspice is due to this flexibility, but in either instance the following must be guided by a reference to what is correct. The lower trigram of Movement represents the eldest son, and the upper trigram of Pleasure represents the youngest daughter. The strong places itself under the weak -- esteeming others higher than himself, and giving the idea of following. The union of Movement with Pleasure suggests the same idea."
    },
    "Notes": "Judgment:  Following means advancement through willpower.\n The Superior Man rests on his inner virtue.\n In Following, the trigram of Movement \"follows\" the trigram of Cheerfulness: independent action subordinates itself and allows itself to be led by cheerful obedience. In terms of the Work, this symbolizes our willingness to \"follow\" or adhere to its principles. Psychologically interpreted, Followingmeans the compliant subordination of ego-autonomy to the Great Work of psychic integration.\n Blofeld points out that the trigram of Joy, or Cheerfulness is often associated with \"willing obedience to and glad acceptance of what is right.\" Hence the cheerful following of the intent of the Self. He explains the role of the superior man in the Image as: \"It is not hard to see the connection between following and resting peacefully; for, once we have given our allegiance to others [the Self], we no longer have to worry about what should be done.\"\n\n\n At seventy ... Confucius allowed his mind to follow whatever it desired, yet everything he did was naturally right of itself. His actions no longer needed a conscious guide. He was acting without effort. This represents the last stage in the development of the sage. \nFung Yu-Lan -- A Short History of Chinese Philosophy\n\n\n When received without changing lines this hexagram often takes the meaning of: \"To accord with\" -- in such instances the answer is an affirmation to your query.",

The tangible results mentioned at the end of the passage imply that we shall not fail. Ritsema/Karcher: Adhering-to correcting significant indeed. Not letting-go indeed. Cleary (2): It is good to follow what is right \u2026In the sense of not losing. Wu: Because following what is correct is auspicious \u2026 Because his position is not compromised.\n Legge:  The dynamic first line is the lord of the lower trigram. The magnetic lines ought to follow him, but he is beneath them in the lowest place in the figure. This suggests that he should change his pursuit. Because of his strength and correct position, he will be fortunate in this. Going beyond his gate for associates shows public spirit and an absence of selfish motivation.",
        "Notes": "Siu:  At the outset, the man changes his objectives. He will succeed if he remains firm in principle and goes beyond selfish considerations to mingle freely with those who do not share his feelings, as well as those who do.\n Wing:  A change is occurring, whether in your own objectives or in the situation around you. In order to accomplish something you should now communicate with persons of all persuasions and opinions. Yet remain internally principled and discerning.\n Editor:  Psychologically, an inner transformation is taking place. If this is the only moving line, hexagram number forty-five, Contraction, is created, so a (possibly unconscious) re-arrangement of attitudes and perceptions is suggested. To \"go beyond one's own gate\" implies a need to expand your horizons during a shift in the balance of forces.\n\n\n When I reached thirty I looked back on my past. The previous victories were not due to my having mastered strategy. Perhaps it was natural ability, or the order of heaven, or that other schools' strategy was inferior. After that I studied morning and evening searching for the principle, and came to realize the Way of Strategy when I was fifty. \r\n           Miyamoto Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings \n\n A.

You are forced to make a choice.\n Editor:  The content of this line prevents using the usual gender symbolism. Nevertheless, the message is unambiguous.\n\n\n Most people learn how to think as very young children, and throughout their adult lives, they do not think any differently than they did as children. That is to say, most people use their minds in a manner not essentially different from the way they did when they were six years old ... It is significant that in Kabbalah, one's normal mode of thinking is referred to as the \"mentality of childhood.\" ... More advanced modes of thought and states of consciousness, on the other hand, are referred to as the \"mentality of adulthood.\" \nAryeh Kaplan -- Jewish Meditation\n\n A.

It is opposite in meaning to line two, and unambiguous.\n\n\n The divine principle in man, which constitutes him a human being, and by which he is eminently distinguished from the animals, is not a product of the earth, nor is it generated by the animal kingdom, but it comes from God; it is God, and is immortal, because, coming from a divine source, it cannot be otherwise than divine. Man should therefore live in harmony with his divine parent, and not in the animal elements of his soul. Man has an Eternal Father who sent him to reside and gain experience in the animal principles, but not for the purpose of being absorbed in them. \nParacelsus -- DeFundamento Sapientiae\n\n A.

There is a chance that he will become dependent on them because of gratifying associations, which will detract from his authority in his position of influence. He must see through such adherents and free himself from egotistical encumbrances.\n Wing: Those whom you appear to influence actually have ulterior motives in their allegiance to you. Look beyond the current flattering situation into your original principled aim. Strive to act independently. \n Editor:  The line is a clear warning about being corrupted by the projections of others. Viewed objectively, the ego is only a temporary personality created for the purpose of transforming psychic energy \u2013 a transitional tool or vessel emanated into matter by the Self for one brief lifetime. It is only a servant--never a master. Long dedication to the Work can concentrate power which the ego may be tempted to use for its own benefit--a dangerous seduction which can only harm the Work.\n\n\n By permitting credulous and vulgar admirers to congregate about thee, there is liability of falling into the error of becoming puffed up with worldly pride. \nGuru Gampopa --Precepts of the Gurus\n\n A.

The faithful and effective subject is rewarded.\n Wing:  You are called upon, by virtue of your wisdom and expertise, to lead another. You will unquestionably become involved, but you will be rewarded for your unselfish commitment.\n Editor:  Psychologically, Legge's commentary suggests the idea of devotion and sacrifice uniting forces in both conscious and unconscious realms of the psyche. The Confucian commentary suggests that the principle of Followingcomes to an end when ego and Self merge. To offer a sacrifice on the peak of the Western mountain: a high spiritual place where the sun sets (an image of the completed Work), implies this. Getting this line doesn't mean the Work is literally completed (it never is in this space-time dimension), but that you have probably integrated some significant inner complexes. Compare this line with 46:4.\n\n\n The surrender of the limited purposes of the ego to the much larger goals of the Self -- goals within which the lesser egoic purposes are in fact meaningfully encompassed -- does not do away with the sense of freedom. On the contrary, only by subordinating the limitations of the ego to the Self do we truly justify our freedom and do we meaningfully validate our responsibility for our actions and decisions. \nS.A.
